<h2>BOOK SECOND.</h2>

<p class='center'>
<i>FROM THE EDICT OF JANUARY (1562)<br />
TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES<br />
THE NINTH (1574).</i>
</p>

<hr class="hr55" />

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class='center'><a name="THE_FIRST_CIVIL_WAR" id="THE_FIRST_CIVIL_WAR"></a>THE FIRST CIVIL WAR.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inconsistencies of the Edict of January.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
The Edict of January was on its very face a compromise, and as such
rested on no firm foundation. Inconsistent with itself, it fully
satisfied neither Huguenot nor Roman Catholic. The latter objected to the
toleration which the edict extended; the former demanded the unrestricted
freedom of worship which it denied. If the existence of two diverse
religions was compatible with the welfare of the state, why ignominiously
thrust the places of Protestant worship from the cities into the suburbs?
If the two were irreconcilable, why suffer the Huguenots to assemble
outside the walls?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot leaders urge the observance of the edict.</div>

<p>Yet there was this difference between the attitude assumed by the rival
parties with reference to the edict: while the Roman Catholic leaders
made no secret of their intention to insist upon its repeal,
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the
Huguenot leaders were urgent in their advice to the churches to conform
strictly to its provisions, restraining the indiscreet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>zeal of their
more impetuous members and exhibiting due gratitude to Heaven for the
amelioration of their lot. To the <i>people</i> it was, indeed, a bitter
disappointment to be compelled to give up the church edifices, and to
resort for public service to the outskirts of the town. Less keen was the
regret experienced by others not less sincerely interested in the
progress of the purer doctrines, who, on account of their appreciation of
the violence of the opposition to be encountered, had not been so
sanguine in their expectations. And so Beza and other prominent men of
the Protestant Church, after obtaining from Chancellor L'Hospital some
further explanations on doubtful points, addressed to their brethren in
all parts of France a letter full of wholesome advice. "God," said they,
"has deigned to employ new means of protecting His church in this
kingdom, by placing those who profess the Gospel under the safeguard of
the king, our natural prince, and of the magistrates and governors
established by him. This should move us so much the more to praise the
infinite goodness of our Heavenly Father, who has at length answered the
cry of His children, and lovingly to obey the king, in order that he may
be induced to aid our just cause." The provisional edict, they added, was
not all that might yet be hoped for. As respected the surrender of the
churches, those Huguenots who had seized them on their own individual
authority ought rather to acknowledge their former indiscretion than
deplore the necessity for restitution. In fine, annoyance at the loss of
a few privileges ought to be forgotten in gratitude for the gain of many
signal advantages.
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The letter produced a deep impression, and its
salutary advice was followed scrupulously, if not cheerfully, even in
southern France, where the Huguenots, in some places, outnumbered the
adherents of the Romish Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seditious Sermons.</div>

<p>The papal party was less ready to acquiesce. The Edict of January was,
according to its representative writers, the most pernicious law for the
kingdom that could have been devised. By forbidding the magistrates from
interfering with the Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
conventicles held in the suburbs, by
permitting the royal officers to attend, by conferring upon the ministers
full liberty of officiating, a formal approval was, for the first time,
given to the new sect under the authority of the royal
seal.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The
pulpits resounded with denunciations of the government. The King of
Navarre and the queen mother were assailed under scriptural names, as
favoring the false prophets of Baal. Scarcely a sermon was preached in
which they did not figure as Ahab and
Jezebel.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
A single specimen of
the spirited discourses in vogue will suffice. A Franciscan monk&mdash;one
Barrier&mdash;the same from whose last Easter sermon an extract has already
been given<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;after
reading the royal ordinance in his church of
Sainte-Croix, in Provins, remarked: "Well now, gentlemen of Provins, what
must I, and the other preachers of France, do? Must we obey this order?
What shall we tell you? What shall we preach? 'The Gospel,' Sir Huguenot
will say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
And pray, stating that the errors of Calvin, of Martin Luther,
of Beza, Malot, Peter Martyr, and other preachers, with their erroneous
doctrine, condemned by the Church a thousand years ago, and since then by
the holy &oelig;cumenical councils, are worthless and damnable&mdash;is not this
preaching the Gospel? Bidding you beware of their teaching, bidding you
refuse to listen to them, or read their books; telling you that they only
seek to stir up sedition, murder, and robbery, as they have begun to do
in Paris and numberless places in the realm&mdash;is not this preaching 'the
Gospel?' But some one may say: 'Pray, friar, what are you saying? You are
not obeying the king's edict; you are still talking of Calvin and his
companions; you call them and those who hold their sentiments <i>heretics</i>
and <i>Huguenots</i>; you will be denounced to the courts of justice, you will
be thrown into prison&mdash;yes, you will be hung as a seditious person.' I
answer, <i>that</i> is not unlikely, for Ahab and Jezebel put to death the
prophets of God in their time, and gave all freedom to the false prophets
of Baal. 'Stop, friar, you are saying too much, you will be hung.' Very
well, then there will be a gray friar hung! Many others will therefore
have to be hung, for God, by His Holy Spirit, will inspire the pillars of
His church to uphold the edifice, which will never be overthrown until
the end of the world, whatever blows may be struck at
it."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of the parliaments.</div>

<p>The parliaments exhibited scarcely less opposition to the edict than did
the pulpits of the Roman Catholic churches. One&mdash;the Parliament of
Dijon&mdash;never registered it at
all;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
while that of Paris instituted a
long and decided resistance. "<i>Non possumus, nec debemus," "non possumus,
nec debemus pro conscientia</i>," were the words in which it replied when
repeatedly pressed to give formal
sanction.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The counsellors were
equally displeased with the contents of the edict, and with the
irregularity committed in sending it first to the provincial parliaments.
Even when the king, yielding to their importunity, by a supplementary
"declaration," interpreted the provision of the edict relative to the
attendance of royal officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
upon the reformed services, as applicable
only to the bailiffs, seneschals, and other minor magistrates, and
strictly prohibited the attendance of the members of parliament and other
high judicatories,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the counsellors, instead of proceeding to the
registry of the obnoxious law, returned a recommendation that the
intolerant Edict of <i>July</i> be enforced!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It was not possible until
March to obtain a tardy assent to the reception of the January Edict into
the legislation of the country, and then only a few of the judges
vouchsafed to take part in the act.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The delay served to inflame yet
more the passions of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New conference.</div>

<p>Scarcely had the edict which was to adjust the relations of the two
religious parties been promulgated, when a new attempt was made to
reconcile the antagonistic beliefs by the old, but ever unsuccessful
method of a conference between theologians. On the twenty-eighth of
January a select company assembled in the large council-chamber of the
royal palace of St. Germain, and commenced the discussion of the first
topic submitted for their deliberation&mdash;the question of pictures or
images and their worship. Catharine herself was present, with Antoine of
Navarre and Jeanne d'Albret, Michel de l'Hospital, and other members of
the council. On the papal side appeared the Cardinals of Bourbon,
Tournon, and Ferrara, and a number of less elevated dignitaries. Beza and
Marlorat were most prominent on the side of the reformed. The discussion
was long and earnest, but it ended leaving all the disputants holding the
same views that they had entertained at the outset. Beza condemned as
idolatrous the practice of admitting statues or paintings into Christian
churches, and urged their entire removal. The Inquisitor De Mouchy, Fra
Giustiniano of Corfu, Maillard, dean of the Sorbonne, and others,
attempted to refute his positions in a style of argument which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> exhibited
the extremes of profound learning and silly conceit. Bishop Montluc of
Valence,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and four doctors of theology&mdash;Salignac, Bouteiller,
D'Espense, and Picherel&mdash;not only admitted the flagrant abuses of
image-worship, but drew up a paper in which they did not disguise their
sentiments. They recommended the removal of representations of the Holy
Trinity, and of pictures immodest in character, or of saints not
recognized by the Church. They reprobated the custom of decking out the
portraits of the saints with crowns and dresses, the celebration of
processions in their honor, and the offering of gifts and vows. And they
yielded so far to the demands of the Protestants as to desire that only
the simple cross should be permitted to remain over the altar, while the
pictures should be placed high upon the walls, where they could neither
be kissed nor receive other objectionable marks of adoration.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It was
a futile task to reconcile views so discordant even among the Roman
Catholic partisans. Two weeks were spent in profitless discussion, and,
on the eleventh of February, the new colloquy was permitted to dissolve
without having entered upon any of the more difficult questions that
still remained upon the programme marked out for it.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The cardinals
had prevailed upon Catharine de' Medici to refer the settlement to the
Council of Trent.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The joy of De Mouchy, the inquisitor, and of his
companions, knew no bounds when Chancellor L'Hospital declared the
queen's pleasure, and requested the members to retire to their homes, and
reduce their opinions to writing for future use. They were ready to throw
themselves on Beza's neck in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> their delight at being relieved of the
necessity of debating with him!<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Defection of Antoine and its results.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Constancy of Jeanne.</div>

<p>But, in truth, the time for the calm discussion of theological
differences, the time for friendly salutation between the champions of
the rival systems of faith, was rapidly drawing to a close. If some rays
of sunshine still glanced athwart the landscape, conveying to the
unpractised eye the impression of quiet serenity, there were also black
and portentous clouds already rising far above the horizon. Those who
could read the signs of the times had long watched their gathering, and
they trembled before the coming of the storm. Although they were
mercifully spared the full knowledge of the overwhelming ruin that would
follow in the wake of that fearful war of the elements, they saw the
angry commotion of the sky, and realized that the air was surcharged with
material for the most destructive bolts of heaven. And yet it is the
opinion of a contemporary, whose views are always worthy of careful
consideration, that, had it not been for the final defection of the King

France might still have been delayed or averted.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> That unhappy prince
seemed determined to earn the title of the "Julian Apostate" of the
French Reformation. Plied by the arts of his own servants, D'Escars (of
whom Mézeray pithily remarks that he was ready to sell himself for money
to anybody, save his master) and the Bishop of Auxerre; flattered by the
Triumvirate, tempted by the Spanish Ambassador, Cardinal Tournon, and the
papal legate, he had long been playing a hypocritical part. He had been
unwilling to break with the Huguenots before securing the golden fruit
with which he was lured on, and so he was at the same time the agent and
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> object of treachery. Even after he had sent in his submission to the
Pope by the hands of D'Escars, he pretended, when remonstrated with by
his Protestant friends, that "he would take care not to go so far that he
could not easily extricate himself."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He did not even show displeasure
when faithfully rebuked and warned.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Yet he had after long hesitation
completely cast in his lot with the papal party. He was convinced at last
that Philip was in earnest in his intention to give him the island of
Sardinia, which was depicted to him as a terrestrial paradise, "worth
four Navarres."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was widely believed that he had received from the
Holy See the promise of a divorce from his heretical consort, which,
while permitting him to retain the possessions which she had justly
forfeited by her spiritual rebellion, would enable him to marry the
youthful Mary of Scots, and add a substantial crown to his titular
claims.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But we would fain believe that even Antoine of Bourbon had
not sunk to such a depth of infamy. Certain it is, however, that he now
openly avowed his new devotion to the Romish Church, and that the
authority of his name became a bulwark of strength to the refractory
parliament in its endeavor to prevent the execution of the edict of
toleration.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But he was unsuccessful in dragging with him the wife
whom he had been the instrument of inducing first to declare herself for
the persecuted faith of the reformers. And when Catharine de' Medici, who
cared nothing for religion, tried to persuade her to arrange matters with
her husband, "Sooner," she said, "than ever go to mass, had I my kingdom
and my son in my hand, I would cast them both into the depth of the sea,
that they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> not be a hinderance to me."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Brave mother of Henry

less of his father's lewdness and inconstancy!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Immense crowds at Huguenot preaching.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The canons of Sainte Croix.</div>

<p>As early as in February, Beza was of the opinion that the King of Navarre
would not suffer him to remain longer in the realm to which he himself
had invited him so earnestly only six months before. At all events, he
would be publicly dismissed by the first of May, and with him many
others. With this disquieting intelligence came also rumors of an
alliance between the enemies of the Gospel and the Spaniard, which could
not be treated with contempt as baseless fabrications.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But meanwhile
the truth was making daily progress. At a single gathering for prayer and
preaching, but a few days before, twenty-five thousand persons, it was
computed, had been in attendance, representing all ranks of the
population, among whom were many of the nobility.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In the city of
Troyes, a few weeks later, eight or nine thousand persons assembled from
the neighboring country to celebrate the Lord's Supper, and the number of
communicants was so great that they could not all partake on a single
day; so the services were repeated on the morrow.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Elsewhere there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
was equal zeal and growth. Indeed, so rapid was the advance of
Protestantism, so pressing the call for ministers, that the large and
flourishing church of Orleans, in a letter written the last day of
February, proclaimed their expectation of establishing a theological
school to supply their own wants and those of the adjacent regions; and
it is no insignificant mark of the power with which the reformatory
movement still coursed on, that the canons of the great church of Sainte
Croix had given notice of their intention to attend the lectures that
were to be delivered!<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In such an encouraging strain did "the
ministers, deacons, and elders" of the most Protestant city of northern
France write on the day before that deplorable massacre of Vassy, which
was to be the signal for an appeal from argument to arms, upon which the
newly enkindled spirit of religious inquiry was to be quenched in
partisan hatred and social confusion. Within less than two months the
tread of an armed host was to be heard in the city which it had been
hoped would be thronged by the pious students of the gospel of peace, and
frenzied soldiers would be hurling upon the floors of Sainte Croix the
statues of the saints that had long occupied their elevated niches.</p>

<p>We must now turn to the events preceding the inauspicious occurrence the
fruits of which proved so disastrous to the French church and state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Guises meet the Duke of Würtemberg at Saverne.</div>

<p>Having at length made sure of the co-operation of the King of Navarre in
the contest upon which they had now resolved with the view of preventing
the execution of the Edict of January, the Guises desired to strengthen
themselves in the direction of Germany, and secure, if not the
assistance, at least the neutrality of the Protestant princes. Could the
Protestants on the other side of the Rhine be made indifferent spectators
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> struggle, persuaded that their own creed resembled the faith of
the Roman Catholics much more than the creed of the Huguenots; could they
be convinced that the Huguenots were uneasy and rebellious radicals, whom
it were better to crush than to assist; could, consequently, the
"reiters" and "lansquenets" be kept at home&mdash;it would, thought the
Guises, be easy, with the help of the German Catholics, perhaps of Spain
also, to render complete the papal supremacy in France, and to crush
Condé and the Châtillons to the earth. Accordingly, the Guises extended
to Duke Christopher of Würtemberg an invitation to meet them in the
little town of Saverne (or Zabern, as it was called by the Germans), in
Alsace, not far from Strasbourg.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The duke came as he was requested,
accompanied by his theologians, Brentius and Andreä; and the interview,
beginning on the fifteenth of February,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> lasted four days. Four of the
Guises were present; but the conversations were chiefly with Francis, the
Duke of Guise, and Charles, the Cardinal of Lorraine; the Cardinal of
Guise and the Grand Prior of the Knights of St. John taking little or no
active part. Christopher and Francis had been comrades in arms a score of
years back, for the former had served several years, and with no little
distinction, in the French wars. This circumstance afforded an
opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> for the display of extraordinary friendship. And what did
the brothers state, in this important consultation, respecting their own
sentiments, the opinions of the Huguenots, and the condition of France?
Happily, a minute account, in the form of a manuscript memorandum taken
down at the time by Duke Christopher, is still extant in the archives of
Stuttgart.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Little known, but authentic beyond the possibility of
cavil, this document deserves more attention than it has received from
historians; for it places in the clearest light the shameless mendacity
of the Guises, and shows that the duke had nearly as good a claim as the
cardinal, his brother, to the reputation which the Venetian ambassador
tells us that Charles had earned "<i>of rarely telling the truth</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lying assurances.</div>

<p>Duke Christopher made the acquaintance of Charles of Lorraine as a
preacher on the morning after his arrival, when he heard him, in a sermon
on the temptation in the wilderness, demonstrate that no other mediators
or intercessors must be sought for but Jesus Christ, who is our only
Saviour and the only propitiation for our sins. That day Christopher had
a long conversation with Guise respecting the unhappy condition of
France, which the latter ascribed in great part to the Huguenot
ministers, whose unconciliatory conduct, he said, had rendered abortive
the Colloquy of Poissy. Würtemberg corrected him by replying that the
very accounts of the colloquy which Guise had sent him showed that the
unsuccessful issue was owing to the prelates, who had evidently come
determined to prevent any accommodation. He urged that the misfortunes
that had befallen France were much rather to be ascribed to the cruel
persecutions that had been inflicted on so many guiltless victims. "I
cannot refrain from telling you," he added, "that you and your brother
are strongly suspected in Germany of having contributed to cause the
death, since the decease of Henry the Second&mdash;and even before, in his
lifetime&mdash;of several thousands of persons who have been miserably
executed on account of their faith. As a friend, and as a Christian, I
must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> warn you. Beware, beware of innocent blood! Otherwise the
punishment of God will fall upon you in this life and in the next." "He
answered me," writes Würtemberg, "<i>with great sighs</i>: 'I know that my
brother and I are accused of that, and of many other things also. But <i>we
are wronged</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> as we shall both of us explain to you before we
leave.'"</p>

<p>The cardinal entered more fully than his brother into the doctrinal
conference, talking now with Würtemberg, now with his theologian
Brentius, and trying to persuade both that he was in perfect accord with
them. While pressing his German friends to declare the Zwinglians and the
Calvinists heretics&mdash;which they carefully avoided doing&mdash;and urging them
to state the punishment that ought to be inflicted on heretics, there
seemed to be no limit to the concessions which Lorraine was willing to
make. He <i>adored</i> and <i>invoked</i> only Christ in heaven. He merely
<i>venerated</i> the wafer. He acknowledged that his party went too far in
calling the mass a sacrifice, and celebrating it for the living and the
dead. The mass was not a sacrifice, but a commemoration of the sacrifice
offered on the altar of the cross ("non sacrificium, sed memoria
sacrificii præstiti in ara crucis"). He believed that the council
assembled at Trent would do no good. When the Romish hierarchy, with the
Pope at its head, as the pretended vicar of God on earth, was objected
to, he replied that that matter could easily be adjusted. As for himself,
"in the absence of a red gown, he would willingly wear a black one."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Guises deceive no one.</div>

<p>He was asked whether, if Beza and his colleagues could be brought to
consent to sign the Augsburg confession, he also would sign it. "You have
heard it," he replied, "I take God to witness that I believe as I have
said, and that by God's grace I shall live and die in these sentiments. I
repeat it: I have read the Confession of Augsburg, I have also read
Luther, Melanchthon, Brentius, and others; I entirely approve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> their
doctrines, and I might speedily agree with them in all that concerns the
ecclesiastical hierarchy. <i>But I am compelled still to dissemble for a
time</i>, that I may gain some that are yet weak in the faith." A little
later he adverted to Würtemberg's remarks to Guise. "You informed my
brother," he said, "that in Germany we are both of us suspected of having
contributed to the execution of a large number of innocent Christians
during the reigns of Henry and of Francis the Second. Well! I swear to
you, in the name of God my Creator, and pledging the salvation of my
soul, <i>that I am guilty of the death of no man condemned for religion's
sake</i>. Those who were then privy to the deliberations of state can
testify in my favor. On the contrary, whenever crimes of a religious
character were under discussion, I used to say to King Henry or to King
Francis the Second, that they did not belong to my department, that they
had to do with the secular power, and I went away."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> He even added
that, although Du Bourg was in orders, he had begged the king to spare
him as a learned man. "In like manner," says Würtemberg, "the Duke of
Guise with great oaths affirmed that he was innocent of the death of
those who had been condemned on account of their faith. 'The attempt,' he
added, 'has frequently been made to kill us, both the cardinal and
myself, with fire-arms, sword, and poison, and, although the culprits
have been arrested, I never meddled with their punishment.'" And when the
Duke of Würtemberg again "conjured them not to persecute the poor
Christians of France, for God would not leave such a sin unpunished,"
both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> cardinal and the Duke of Guise gave him their right hands,
promising on their princely faith, and by the salvation of their souls,
that they would neither openly nor secretly persecute the partisans of
the "new doctrines!" Such were the barefaced impostures which this "par
nobile fratrum" desired Christopher of Würtemberg to publish for their
vindication among the Lutherans of Germany. But the liars were not
believed. The shrewd Landgrave of Hesse, on receiving Würtemberg's
account, even before the news of the massacre of Vassy, came promptly to
the conclusion that the whole thing was an attempt at deception.
Christopher himself, in the light of later events, added to his
manuscript these words: "Alas! It can now be seen how they have kept
these promises! <i>Deus sit ultor doli et perjurii, cujus namque res
agitur.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Throkmorton's account of the French court.</div>

<p>Meanwhile events of the greatest consequence were occurring at the
capital. The very day after the Saverne conference began, Sir Nicholas
Throkmorton wrote to Queen Elizabeth an account of "the strange issue" to
which affairs had come at the French court since his last despatch, a
little over a fortnight before. His letter gives a vivid and accurate
view of the important crisis in the first half of February, 1562, which
we present very nearly in the words of the ambassador himself. "The
Cardinal of Ferrara," says Throkmorton, "has allured to his devotion the
King of Navarre, the Constable, Marshal St. André, the Cardinal of
Tournon, and others inclined to retain the Romish religion. All these are
bent to repress the Protestant religion in France, and to find means
either to range [bring over to their side] the Queen of Navarre, the
Prince of Condé, the Admiral, and all others who favor that religion, or
to expel them from the court, with all the ministers and preachers. The
queen mother, fearing this conspiracy might be the means of losing her
authority (which is as dear to her as one religion or the other), and
mistrusting that the Constable was going about to reduce the management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the whole affair into the King of Navarre's hands, and so into his
own, has caused the Constable to retire from the court, as it were in
disgrace, and intended to do the like with the Cardinal of Tournon and
the Marshal St. André. The King of Navarre being offended with these
proceedings, and imputing part of her doings to the advice of the
Admiral, the Cardinal Châtillon, and Monsieur D'Andelot, intended to
compel those personages to retire also from the court. In these garboils
[commotions] the Prince of Condé, being sick at Paris, was requested to
repair to the court and stand her [Catharine] in stead. In this time
there was great working on both sides to win the house of Guise. So the
Queen Mother wrote to them&mdash;they being in the skirts of Almain&mdash;to come
to the court with all speed. The like means were made [use of] by the
King of Navarre, the Cardinal of Ferrara and the Constable, to ally them
on their part. During these solicitations the Duke D'Aumale arrived at
the court from them, who was requested to solicit the speedy repair to
the court of the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of Lorraine.</p>

<p>"The Prince of Condé went from hence in a horse litter to the court of
St. Germain, where he found the Protestant preachers prohibited from
preaching either in the King's house or in the town, and that the King of
Navarre had solemnly vowed to retain and maintain the Romish religion,
and had given order that his son should be instructed in the same. The
Prince, finding the Queen of Navarre and the house of Châtillon ready to
leave the court, fell again dangerously sick. Nevertheless his coming so
revived them, as by the covert aid of the Queen Mother, they attempted to
make the Protestant preachers preach again at the town's end of St.
Germain, and were entreated to abide at the court, where there is an
assembly which is like to last until Easter. The Cardinal of Ferrara
assists daily at these disputes. The King of Navarre persists in the
house of Châtillon retiring from the court, and it is believed the Queen
of Navarre, and they, will not tarry long there."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Such was the picture drawn by the skilful pencil of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> envoy.
It was certainly dark enough. Catharine and Navarre had sent Lansac to
assure the Pope that they purposed to live in and defend the Roman
Catholic religion. Sulpice had gone on a like mission to Spain. It was
time, Throkmorton plainly told Queen Elizabeth, that she should show as
great readiness in maintaining the Protestant religion as Ferrara and his
associates showed in striving to overthrow it. And in a private despatch
to Cecil, written the same day, he urged the secretary to dissuade her
Majesty from longer retaining candles and cross on the altar of the royal
chapel, at a time when even doctors of the Sorbonne consented to the
removal of images of all sorts from over the altar in places of
worship.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>From Saverne the Cardinal of Lorraine returned to his archbishopric of
Rheims, while the duke, accompanied by the Cardinal of Guise, proceeded
in the direction of the French capital. On his route he stopped at
Joinville, one of the estates of the family, recently erected in their
favor into a principality. Here he was joined by his wife, Anne d'Este;
here, too, he listened to fresh complaints made by his mother, Antoinette
of Bourbon, against the insolence of the neighboring town of Vassy, where
a considerable portion of the inhabitants had lately had the audacity to
embrace the reformed faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vassy in Champagne.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the Huguenot Church.</div>

<p>Vassy, an important town of Champagne&mdash;though shorn of much of its
influence by the removal of many of its dependencies to increase the
dignity of Joinville&mdash;and one of the places assigned to Mary of Scots for
her maintenance, had apparently for some time contained a few professors
of the "new doctrines." It was, however, only in October, 1561, after the
Colloquy of Poissy, that it was visited by a Protestant minister, who,
during a brief sojourn, organized a church with elders and deacons.
Notwithstanding the disadvantage of having no pastor, and of having
notoriously incurred the special hatred of the Guises, the reformed
community grew with marvellous rapidity. For the Gospel was preached not
merely in the printed sermons read from the pulpit, but by the lips of
enthusiastic converts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> When, after a short absence, the founder of the
church of Vassy returned to the scene of his labors, he came into
collision with the Bishop of Châlons, whose diocese included this town.
The bishop, unaccustomed to preach, set up a monk in opposition; but no
one would come to hear him. The prelate then went himself to the
Protestant gathering, and sat through the "singing of the commandments"
and a prayer. But when he attempted to interrupt the services and
asserted his episcopal authority, the minister firmly repelled the
usurpation, taking his stand on the king's edict. Then, waxing warm in
the discussion, the dauntless Huguenot exposed the hypocrisy of the
pretended shepherd, who, not entering the fold by canonical election, but
intruding himself into it without consulting his charge, was more anxious
to secure his own ease than to lead his sheep into green pastures. The
bishop soon retired from a field where he had found more than his match
in argument: but the common people, who had come to witness his triumph
over the Huguenot preacher, remained after his unexpected discomfiture,
and the unequal contest resulted in fresh accessions to the ranks of the
Protestants. Equally unsuccessful was the Bishop of Châlons in the
attempt to induce the king to issue a commission to the Duke of Guise
against the unoffending inhabitants, and Vassy was spared the fate of
Mérindol and Cabrières. At Christmas nine hundred communicants, after
profession of their faith, partook of the Lord's Supper according to the
reformed rites; and in January, 1562, after repeated solicitations, the
church obtained the long-desired boon of a pastor, in the person of the
able and pious Leonard Morel. Thus far the history of Vassy differed
little from that of hundreds of other towns in that age of wonderful
awakening and growth, and would have attracted little attention had not
its proximity to the Lorraine princes secured for it a tragic
notoriety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Approach of the Duke of Guise.</div>

<p>On the twenty-eighth of February, Guise, with two hundred armed
retainers, left Joinville. That night he slept at Dommartin-le-Franc. On
Sunday morning, the first of March, he continued his journey. Whether by
accident or from design, it is difficult to say, he drew near to Vassy
about the time when the Huguenots were assembling for worship, and his
ears caught the sound of their bell while he was still a quarter of a
league distant. The ardor of Guise's followers was already at fever-heat.
They had seen a poor artisan apprehended in a town that lay on their
track, and summarily hung by their leader's order, for the simple offence
of having had his child baptized after the reformed rites. When Guise
heard the bell of the Vassy church, he turned to his suite to inquire
what it meant. "It is the Huguenots' preaching," some one replied. "<i>Par
la mort-Dieu</i>," broke in a second, "they will soon be huguenotted after
another fashion!" Others began to make eager calculations respecting the
extent of the plunder. A few minutes later an unlucky cobbler was espied,
who, from his dress or manner, was mistaken for a Huguenot minister. It
was well that he could answer the inquiries of the duke, before whom he
was hurried, by assuring him that he was no clergyman and had never
studied; otherwise, he was told, his case had been an extremely ugly
one.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The massacre.</div>

<p>On entering Vassy Guise repaired to the monastery chapel to hear mass
said. He was followed by some of the gentlemen of his suite. Meantime,
their valets found their way to the doors of the building in which the
Protestants were worshipping, scarcely more than a stone's throw distant.
This motley crowd was merely the vanguard of the Papists. Soon two or
three gentlemen sent by Guise, according to his own account, to admonish
the Huguenot assembly of their want of due obedience, entered the
edifice, where they found twelve hundred persons quietly listening to the
word of God. They were politely invited to sit down: but they replied by
noisy interruption and threats. "<i>Mort-Dieu</i>, they must all be killed!"
was their exclamation as they returned to report to Guise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> what they had
seen. The defenceless Huguenots were thrown into confusion by these
significant menaces, and hastened to secure the entrance. It was too
late. The duke himself was approaching, and a volley from the arquebuses
of his troop speedily scattered the unarmed worshippers. It is
unnecessary to describe in all its details of horror the scene that
ensued. The door of the sheep-fold was open and the wolf was already upon
his prey. All the pent-up hatred of a band of fanatical and savage
soldiers was vented upon a crowd of men, women, and children, whose
heterodoxy made them pleasing victims, and whose unarmed condition
rendered victory easy. No age, no sex was respected. It was enough to be
a Huguenot to be a fit object for the sword or the gun. To escape from
the doomed building was only possible by running the gauntlet of the
troops that lay in wait. Those who sought to climb from the roof to the
adjacent houses were picked off by the arquebuses of the besieging party.
Only after an hour and a half had elapsed were the soldiers of Guise
called off by the trumpet sounding a joyful note of victory. The evidence
of their prowess, however, remained on the field of contest, in fifty or
sixty dead or dying men and women, and in nearly a hundred more or less
dangerously wounded.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In a few hours more Guise was resuming his journey toward Paris. He was
told that the Huguenots of Vassy had forwarded their complaints to the
king. "Let them go, let them go!" he exclaimed. "They will find there
neither their Admiral nor their Chancellor."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon whose head rests the guilt of the massacre of Vassy? This was the
question asked by every contemporary so soon as he realized the startling
fact that the blow there struck was a signal that called every man to
take the sword, and stand in defence of his own life. It is the question
which history, more calm and dispassionate, because farther removed from
the agitations of the day, now seeks to solve, as she looks back over the
dreary torrents of blood that sprang from that disastrous source. The
inquiry is not an idle one&mdash;for justice ought to find such a vindication
in the records of past generations as may have been denied at the time of
the commission of flagrant crimes.</p>

<p>The Huguenots declared Guise to be a murderer. Theodore Beza, in eloquent
tones, demanded the punishment of the butcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> of the human race. So
imposing was the cry for retribution that the duke himself recognized the
necessity of entering a formal defence, which was disseminated by the
press far and wide through France and Germany. He denied that the
massacre was premeditated. He averred that it was merely an unfortunate
incident brought about by the violence of the Protestants of Vassy, who
had provided themselves with an abundant supply of stones and other
missiles, and assailed those whom he had sent to remonstrate courteously
with them. He stated the deaths at only twenty-five or thirty. Most of
these had been occasioned by the indignant valets, who, on seeing their
masters wounded, had rushed in to defend them. So much against his will
had the affair occurred, that he had repeatedly but ineffectually
commanded his men to desist. When he had himself received a slight wound
from a stone thrown by the Huguenots, the sight of the blood flowing from
it had infuriated his devoted followers.</p>

<p>The Duke's plea of want of premeditation we may, perhaps, accept as
substantially true&mdash;so far, at least, as to suppose that he had formed no
deliberate plan of slaughtering the inhabitants of Vassy who had adopted
the reformed religion.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It is difficult, indeed, to accept the
argument of Brantôme and Le Laboureur, who conceive that the fortuitous
character of the event is proved by the circumstance that the deed was
below the courage of Guise. Nor, perhaps, shall we give excessive credit
to the asseverations of the duke, repeated, we are told, even on his
death-bed. For why should these be more worthy of belief than the oaths
with which the same nobleman had declared to Christopher of Würtemberg
that he neither had persecuted, nor would persecute the Protestants of
France? But the Duke of Guise admits that he knew that there was a
growing community of Huguenots at Vassy&mdash;"scandalous, arrogant,
extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> seditious persons," as he styles them. He tells us that he
intended, as the representative of Mary Stuart, and as feudal lord of
some of their number, to admonish them of their disobedience; and that
for this purpose he sent Sieur de la Bresse (or Brosse) with others to
interrupt their public worship. He accuses them, it is true, of having
previously armed themselves with stones, and even of possessing weapons
in an adjoining building; but what reason do the circumstances of the
case give us for doubting that the report may have been based upon the
fact that those who in this terror-stricken assembly attempted to save
their lives resorted to whatever missiles they could lay their hands
upon? If the presence of his wife, and of his brother the cardinal, is
used by the duke as an argument to prove the absence of any sinister
intentions on his part, how much stronger is the evidence afforded to the
peaceable character of the Protestant gathering by the numbers of women
and children found there? But the very fact that, as against the
twenty-five or thirty Huguenots whom he concedes to have been slain in
the encounter, he does not pretend to give the name of a single one of
his own followers that was killed, shows clearly which side it was that
came prepared for the fight. And yet who that knows the sanguinary spirit
generally displayed by the Roman Catholic masses in the sixteenth
century, could find much fault with the Huguenots of Vassy if they had
really armed themselves to repel violence and protect their wives and
children&mdash;if, in other words, they had used the common right of
self-preservation?<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p><p>The fact is that Guise was only witnessing the fruits of his
instructions, enforced by his own example. He had given the first taste
of blood, and now, perhaps without his actual command, the pack had taken
the scent and hunted down the game. He was avowedly on a crusade to
re-establish the supremacy of the Roman Catholic religion throughout
France. If he had not hesitated to hang a poor pin-dealer for allowing
his child to be baptized according to the forms of Calvin's liturgy; if
he was on his way to Paris to restore the Edict of July by force of arms,
it is idle to inquire whether he or his soldiers were responsible for the
blood shed in peace. "He that sowed the seed is the author of the
harvest."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé appeals to the king.</div>

<p>The news quickly flew to Condé that the arch-enemy of the Protestants had
begun the execution of the cruel projects he had so long been devising
with his fanatical associates; that Guise was on his way toward seditious
Paris, with hands yet dripping with the blood of the inhabitants of a
quiet Champagnese town, surprised and murdered while engaged in the
worship of their God. Indignant, and taking in the full measure of the
responsibility imposed upon him as the most powerful member of the
Protestant communion, the prince, who was with the court at the castle of
Monceaux&mdash;built for herself by Catharine in a style of regal
magnificence&mdash;laid before the king and his mother a full account of the
tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> occurrence. It was a pernicious example, he argued, and should be
punished promptly and severely. Above all, the perpetrators ought not to
be permitted to endanger the quiet of France by entering the capital.
Catharine was alarmed and embarrassed by the intelligence; but, her fear
of a conjunction between Guise and Navarre overcoming her reluctance to
affront the Lorraine family, induced her to consent; and she wrote to the
Duke, who had by this time reached his castle of Nanteuil, forbidding him
to go to Paris, but inviting him to visit the court with a small escort.
At the same time she gave orders to Saint André to repair at once to
Lyons, of which he was the royal governor. But neither of the triumvirs
showed any readiness to obey her orders. The duke curtly replied that he
was too busy entertaining his friends to come to the king; the marshal
promptly refused to leave the king while he was threatened by such
perils.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beza's remonstrance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An anvil that has worn out many hammers.</div>

<p>The King of Navarre now came from Paris to Monceaux, to guard the
interests of the party he had espoused. He was closely followed by
Theodore Beza and Francour, whom the Protestants of Paris had deputed,
the former on behalf of the church, the latter of the nobility, to demand
of the king the punishment of the authors of the massacre. The queen
mother, as was her wont, gave a gracious audience, and promised that an
investigation should be made. But Navarre, being present, seemed eager to
display a neophyte's zeal, and retorted by blaming the Huguenots for
going in arms to their places of worship. "True," said Beza, "but arms in
the hands of the wise are instruments of peace, and the massacre of Vassy
has shown the necessity under which the Protestants were laid." When
Navarre exclaimed: "Whoever touches my brother of Guise with the tip of
his finger, touches my whole body!" the reformer reminded him, as one
whom Antoine had himself brought to France, that the way of justice is
God's way, and that kings <i>owe</i> justice to their subjects. Finally, when
he discovered, by Navarre's adoption of all the impotent excuses of
Guise, that the former had sold himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> enemies of the Gospel,
Theodore Beza made that noble reply which has become classic as the motto
of the French Reformation: "Sire, it is, in truth, the lot of the Church
of God, in whose name I am speaking, to endure blows and not to strike
them. <i>But also may it please you to remember that it is an anvil that
has worn out many hammers.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Guise's entry into Paris.</div>

<p>At Nanteuil, Guise had been visited by the constable, with two of his
sons, by Saint André, and by other prominent leaders. Accompanied by
them, he now took the decided step of going to Paris in spite of
Catharine's prohibition. His entry resembled a triumphal procession.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
In the midst of an escort estimated by eye-witnesses at two thousand
horse, Francis of Guise avoided the more direct gate of St. Martin, and
took that of St. Denis, through which the kings of France were accustomed
to pass. Vast crowds turned out to meet him, and the cries of "<i>Vive
Monsieur de Guise!</i>" sounding much like regal acclammations, were uttered
without rebuke on all sides. The "prévost des marchands" and other
members of the municipal government received him with great
demonstrations of joy, as the defender of the faith. At the same hour the
Prince of Condé, surrounded by a large number of Protestant noblemen,
students, and citizens, was riding to one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> preaching-places.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The two cavalcades met, but no collision ensued. The Huguenot and the
papist courteously saluted each other, and then rode on. It is even
reported that between the leaders themselves less sincere amenities were
interchanged. Guise sent word to Condé that he and his company, whom he
had assembled only on account of the malevolent, were at the prince's
commands. Condé answered by saying that his own men were armed only to
prevent the populace of Paris from making an attack upon the Protestants
as they went to their place of worship.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anxieties of Catharine de' Medici.</div>

<p>For weeks the position of the queen mother had been one of peculiar
difficulty and anxiety. That she was "well inclined to advance the true
religion," and "well affected for a general reformation in the Church,"
as Admiral Coligny at this time firmly believed,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> is simply
incredible. But, on the other hand, there can be little doubt that
Catharine saw her interest in upholding the Huguenot party, of which
Condé and the three Châtillon brothers were acknowledged leaders.
Unfortunately, the King of Navarre, "hoping to compound with the King of
Spain for his kingdom of Navarre," had become the tool of the opposite
side&mdash;he was "<i>all Spanish now</i>"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>&mdash;and Chantonnay, Philip's
ambassador, was emboldened to make arrogant demands. The envoy declared
that, "unless the house of Châtillon left the court, he was ordered to
depart from France." Grave diplomatists shook their heads, and thought
the menace very strange, "the rather that another prince should appoint
what counsellors should remain at court;" and sage men inferred that "to
such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> princes as are afraid of shadows the King of Spain will enterprise
far enough."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> None the less was Catharine deeply disturbed. She felt
distrust of the heads of the Roman Catholic party, but she feared to
break entirely with them, and was forced to request the Protestant
leaders to withdraw for a time from the vicinity of Paris. That city
itself presented to the eye a sufficiently strange and alarming aspect,
"resembling more a frontier town or a place besieged than a court, a
merchant city, or university." Both sides were apprehensive of some
sudden commotion, and the Protestant scholars, in great numbers, marched
daily in arms to the "sermons," in spite of the opposition of the rector
and his council.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The capital was unquestionably no place for
Catharine and her son, at the present moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">She removes the king to Melun.</div>

<div class="sidenote">and thence to Fontainebleau.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Her painful indecision.</div>

<p>At length, Catharine de' Medici, apprehensive of the growing power of the
triumvirate, and dreading lest the king, falling into its hands, should
become a mere puppet, her own influence being completely thrown into the
shade, removed the court from Monceaux to Melun, a city on the upper
Seine, about twenty-five miles south-east of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> She hoped
apparently that, by placing herself nearer the strongly Huguenot banks of
the Loire, she would be able at will to throw herself into the arms of
either party, and, in making her own terms, secure future independence.
But she was not left undisturbed. At Melun she received a deputation from
Paris, consisting of the "prévost des marchands" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> three "échevins,"
who came to entreat her, in the name of the Roman Catholic people of the
capital, to return and dissipate by the king's arrival the dangers that
were imminent on account of Condé's presence, and to give the people the
power to defend themselves by restoring to them their arms. Still
hesitating, still experiencing her old difficulty of forming any plans
for the distant future, and every moment balancing in her mind what she
should do the next, she nevertheless pushed on ten miles farther
southward, to the royal palace of Fontainebleau, and found herself not
far from half the way to Orleans. But change of place brought the
vacillating queen mother no nearer to a decision. Soubise, the last of
the avowed Protestants to leave her, still dreamed he might succeed in
persuading her. Day after day, in company with Chancellor L'Hospital, the
Huguenot leader spent two or three hours alone with her in earnest
argument. "Sometimes," says a recently discovered contemporary account,
"they believed that they had gained everything, and that she was ready to
set off for Condé's camp; then, all of a sudden, so violent a fright
seized her, that she lost all heart." At last the time came when the
triumvirs were expected to appear at Fontainebleau on the morrow, to
secure the prize of the king's person. Soubise and the indefatigable
chancellor made a last attempt. Five or six times in one day they
returned to the charge, although L'Hospital mournfully observed that he
had abandoned hope. He knew Catharine well: she could not be brought to a
final resolution.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> It was even so. Soubise himself was forced to admit
it when, at the last moment&mdash;almost too late for his own safety&mdash;he
hurriedly left, Catharine still begging him to stand by her, and made his
way to his friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">She implores Condé's aid.</div>

<p>It seems to have been during this time of painful anxiety that Catharine
wrote at least the last of those remarkable letters to Condé which that
prince afterward published in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> justification, and respecting the
authenticity of which the queen would have been glad had she been able to
make the world entertain doubts. They breathed a spirit of implicit
confidence. She called herself his "good cousin," that was not less
attached to him than a mother to a son. She enjoined upon him to remember
the protection which he was bound to give to "the children, the mother,
and the kingdom." She called upon him not to desert her. She declared
that, in the midst of so many adverse circumstances, she would be driven
almost to despair, "were it not for her trust in God, and the assurance
that Condé would assist her in preserving the kingdom and service of the
king, her son, in spite of those who wished to ruin everything." More
than once she told him that his kindness would not go unrequited; and she
declared that, if she died before having an opportunity to testify her
gratitude, she would charge her children with the duty.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In Paris events were rapidly succeeding each other. Marshal Montmorency,
the constable's eldest son, was too upright a man to serve the purposes
of the triumvirs; and, with his father's consent and by Navarre's
authority, he was removed, and Cardinal Bourbon installed in his place as
governor of the city.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> A few days after Antoine himself came to Paris
and lodged in the constable's house. Here, with Guise, Saint André, and
the other chief statesmen who were of the same party, conferences were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
held to which Condé and his associates were not invited; and to these
irregular gatherings, notwithstanding the absence of the king, the name
of the <i>royal council</i> was given.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé retires to Meaux.</div>

<p>There were nine or ten thousand horse&mdash;Papist and Huguenot&mdash;under arms in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It was evident that Condé and Guise could not longer remain in
the city without involving it in the most bloody of civil contests. Under
these circumstances the prince offered, through his brother, the Cardinal
of Bourbon, to accede to the wish of Catharine, and leave Paris by one
gate at the same moment that the triumvirs should leave by another.
Indeed, without waiting to obtain their promise, he retired<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> with his
body of Protestant noblesse to Meaux, where he had given a rendezvous to
Admiral Coligny and others whom he had summoned from their homes. This
step has generally been stigmatized as the first of Condé's egregious
mistakes. Beza opposed it at the time, and likened the error to that of
Pompey in abandoning Rome;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and the "History of the Reformed Churches"
has perpetuated the comparison.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The same historical parallel was
drawn by Étienne Pasquier.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But the judicious François de la Noue,
surnamed <i>Bras-de-Fer</i>, thought very differently; and we must here, as in
many other instances, prefer the opinion of the practical soldier to that
of the eminent theologian or the learned jurist. Parliament, the clergy,
the municipal government, the greater part of the university, and almost
all the low populace, with the partisans and servants of the hostile
princes and noblemen, were intensely Roman Catholic.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The three
hundred resident Protestant gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>tlemen, with, as many more experienced
soldiers, four hundred students, and a few untrained burgesses, were "but
as a fly matched with an elephant." The novices of the convents and the
priests' chambermaids, armed only with sticks, could have held them in
check.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It were better to lose the advantages of the capital than to
be overwhelmed within its walls by superior forces, being completely cut
off from that part of France where the main strength of the Protestants
lay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenot summons.</div>

<p>From Meaux messengers were sent to the Protestant churches in all parts
of France to request their aid, both in money and in men. "Since," said
the letter they bore, "God has brought us to such a point that no one can
disturb our repose without violating the protection it has pleased our
king to accord us, and consequently without declaring himself an enemy of
his Majesty and of this kingdom's peace, there is no law, divine or
human, that does not permit us to take measures for defence, calling for
help on those whom God has given the authority and the will to remedy
these evils."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Admiral Coligny's reluctance.</div>

<p>Happily for the Huguenot cause, however, the nobles and gentry that
favored it had not waited to receive this summons, but had, many of them,
already set out to strengthen the forces of the prince. Among others, and
by far more important than all the rest, came Gaspard de Coligny, whose
absence from court during the few previous weeks has been regarded as one
of the most untoward circumstances of the time. At his pleasant castle of
Châtillon-sur-Loing, surrounded by his young family, he received
intelligence, first, of the massacre, then of the ominous events that had
occurred at the capital. Condé sent to solicit his support; his brothers
and many friends urged him to rush at once to the rescue. But still, even
after the threatening clouds had risen so high that they must soon burst
over the devoted heads of the Huguenots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> the admiral continued to
hesitate. Every instinct of his courageous nature prompted the skilful
defender of St. Quentin to place himself at once at the post of danger.
But there was one fear that seemed likely to overcome all his martial
impulses. <i>It was the fear of initiating a civil war.</i> He could not refer
to the subject without shuddering, for the horrors of such a contest were
so vividly impressed upon his mind that he regarded almost anything as
preferable to the attempt to settle domestic difficulties by an appeal to
the sword. But the tears and sighs of his wife, the noble Charlotte de
Laval, at length overmastered his reluctance. "To be prudent in men's
esteem," she said, "is not to be wise in that of God, who has given you
the science of a general that you might use it for the good of His
children." When her husband rehearsed again the grounds of his
hesitation, and, calling upon her seriously to consider the suffering,
the privations, the anxiety, the bereavements, the ignominy, the death
which would await not only those dearest to her, but herself, if the
struggle should prove unsuccessful, offered her three weeks to make her
decision, with true womanly magnanimity she replied: "The three weeks are
already past; you will never be conquered by the strength of your
enemies. Make use of your resources, and bring not upon your head the
blood of those who may die within three weeks. I summon you in God's name
not to defraud us any more, or I shall be a witness against you at His
judgment." So deep was the impression which these words made upon
Coligny, that, accepting his wife's advice as the voice of heaven, he
took horse without further delay, and joined Condé and the other
Protestant leaders.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king seized and brought to Paris.</div>

<p>It was unfortunate that the prince, for a week after leaving Paris,
should have felt too feeble to make any movement of importance.
Otherwise, by a rapid march, he might, according to his plan,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> have
reached Fontainebleau in advance of his oppo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>nents, and, with the young
king and his mother under his protection, have asserted his right as a
prince of the blood to defend Charles against those who had unjustly
usurped the functions of royalty. As it was, the unlucky delay was turned
to profit by his enemies. These now took a step that put further
deliberation on Catharine's part out of the question, and precluded any
attempt to place the person of the king in Condé's hands. Leaving a small
garrison in Paris, Guise proceeded with a strong body of troops to
Fontainebleau, determined to bring the king and his mother back to Paris.
Persuasion was first employed; but, that failing, the triumvirate were
prepared to resort to force. Navarre, acting at Guise's suggestion, at
length told Catharine distinctly that, as guardian of the minor king, he
must see to it that he did not fall into his brother's hands; as for
Catharine, she might remain or follow him, as she pleased.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Tears and

brought him with his mother first to Melun, then, after a few days, to
the prison-like castle of Vincennes, and finally to the Louvre.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">D'Andelot and Condé throw themselves into Orleans.</div>

<p>The critical step had been taken to demonstrate that the reign of
tolerance, according to the prescriptions of the Edict of January, was at
an end. The constable, preceding the king to Paris, immediately upon his
arrival instituted a system of arbitrary arrests. On the next morning
(the fourth of April) he visited the "temple of Jerusalem,"<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> one of
the two places which had been accorded to the Huguenots for their worship
outside of the walls. Under his direction the pulpit and the benches of
the hearers were torn up, and a bonfire of wood and Bibles was speedily
lighted, to the great delight of the populace of Paris. In the afternoon
the same exploits were repeated at the other Huguenot church, known from
its situation, outside of the gate of St. Antoine, as "<i>Popincourt</i>."
Here, however, not only the benches, but the building itself was burned,
and several adjacent houses were involved in the conflagration. Having
accomplished these outrages and encouraged the people to imitate his
lawless example, the aged constable returned to the city. He had well
earned the contemptuous name which the Huguenots henceforth gave him of
"Le Capitaine <i>Brûlebanc</i>."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> If the triumvirate succeeded, it was
plain that all liberty of worship was proscribed. It was even believed
that the Duchess of Guise had been sent to carry a message, in the king's
name, to her mother, the aged Renée of France, to the effect that if she
did not dismiss the Huguenot preachers from Montargis, and become a good
Catholic, he would have her shut up for the rest of her life in a
convent.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Whatever truth there may have been in this story, one thing
was certain: in Paris it would have been as much as any man's life was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
worth to appear annoyed at the constable's exploit, or to oppose the
search made for arms in suspected houses. Every good Catholic had a piece
of the Huguenots' benches or pulpit in his house as a souvenir; "so
odious," says a contemporary, "is the new religion in this city."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Meantime, on Easter Monday (the thirtieth of March) Condé left Meaux at
the head of fifteen hundred horse, the flower of the French nobility,
"better armed with courage than with corselets"&mdash;says François de la
Noue. As they approached the capital, the whole city was thrown into
confusion, the gates were closed, and the chains stretched across the
streets.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But the host passed by, and at St. Cloud crossed the Seine
without meeting any opposition. Here the news of the seizure of the
person of Charles by the triumvirs first reached the prince, and with it
one great object of the expedition was frustrated.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The Huguenots,
however, did not delay, but, instead of turning toward Fontainebleau,
took a more southerly route directly for the city of Orleans. D'Andelot,
to whom the van had been confided, advanced by a rapid march, and
succeeded by a skilful movement in entering the city, of which he took
possession in the name of the Prince of Condé, acting as lieutenant of
the king unlawfully held in confinement. Catharine de' Medici, who,
having been forced into the party of the triumvirs, had with her usual
flexibility promptly decided to make the most of her position, sent
messengers to Condé hoping to amuse him with negotiations while a
powerful Roman Catholic detachment should by another road reach Orleans
un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>observed.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But the danger coming to Andelot's knowledge, he
succeeded in warning Condé; and the prince, with the main body of the
Protestant horse, after a breakneck ride, threw himself, on the second of
April, into the city, which now became the headquarters of the religion
in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The inhabitants came out to meet him with every
demonstration of joy, and received him between double lines of men,
women, and children loudly singing the words of the French psalms, so
that the whole city resounded with them.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé's justification.</div>

<p>No sooner had the Prince of Condé established himself upon the banks of
the Loire, than he took measures to explain to the world the necessity
and propriety of the step upon which he had ventured. He wrote, and he
induced the Protestant ministers who were with him to write, to all the
churches of France, urging them to send him reinforcements of troops and
to fill his empty treasury.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> At the same time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> published a
"declaration" in justification of his resort to arms. He recapitulated
the successive steps that revealed the violent purposes of the
triumvirs&mdash;the retreat of the Guises and of the constable from court,
Nemours's attempt to carry the Duke of Orleans out of the kingdom, the
massacre at Vassy, Guise's refusal to visit the royal court and his
defiant progress to the capital, the insolent conduct of Montmorency and
Saint-André, the pretended <i>royal</i> council held away from the king, the
detention of Charles and of his mother as prisoners. And from all these
circumstances he showed the inevitable inference to be that the triumvirs
had for one of their chief objects the extirpation of the religion "which
they call new," "either by open violence or by the change of edicts, and
the renewal of the most cruel persecutions that have ever been exercised
in the world." It was not party interest that had induced him to take up
arms, he said, but loyalty to God, to his king, and to his native land, a
desire to free Charles from unlawful detention, and a purpose to insist
upon the execution of the royal edicts, especially that of January, and
to prevent new ministers of state from misapplying the sums raised for
the payment of the national debts. He warned all lovers of peace not to
be astonished at any edicts that might emanate from the royal seal so
long as the king remained a prisoner, and he begged Catharine to order
the triumvirs to lay down their arms. If they did so, he declared that he
himself, although of a rank far different from theirs, would consent to
follow their example.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Stringent articles of association.</div>

<p>The Huguenots had thrown off the shackles which a usurping party about
the king endeavored to fasten upon them; but they had not renounced the
restraints of law. And now, at the very commencement of a great struggle
for liberty, they entered into a solemn compact to banish licentious
excesses from their army. Protesting the purity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> their motives, they
swore to strive until the king's majority to attain the objects which had
united them in a common struggle; but they promised with equal fervor to
watch over the morals of their associates, and to suffer nothing that was
contrary to God's honor or the king's edicts, to tolerate no idolatrous
or superstitious practices, no blasphemy, no uncleanness or theft, no
violation of churches by private authority. They declared their intention
and desire to hear the Word of God preached by faithful ministers in the
midst of the camps of war.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot nobles and cities.</div>

<p>The papal party was amazed at the opposition its extreme measures had
created. In place of the timid weakling whom the triumvirate had
expected, they saw a giant spring from the ground to confront them.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
To Orleans flocked many of the highest nobles of the land. Besides
Condé&mdash;after Navarre and Bourbon, the prince of the blood nearest to the
crown&mdash;there were gathered to the Protestant standard the three
Châtillons, Prince Porcien, Count de la Rochefoucauld, the Sieurs de
Soubise, de Mouy, de Saint Fal, d'Esternay, Piennes, Rohan, Genlis,
Grammont, Montgomery, and others of high station and of large influence
and extensive landed possessions.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And, what was still more important,
the capture of Orleans was but the signal for a general movement
throughout France. In a few weeks the Huguenots, rising in their
unsuspected strength, had rendered themselves masters of cities in almost
every province. Along the Loire, Beaugency, Blois, Tours, and Angers
declared for the Prince of Condé; in Normandy, Rouen, Havre, Dieppe, and
Caen; in Berry and the neighboring provinces, Bourges, La Rochelle,
Poitiers; along the Saône and Rhône, Châlons, Mâcon, Lyons, Vienne,
Valence, Montélimart, Tournon, Orange; Gap and Grenoble in Dauphiny;
almost the whole of the papal "Comtât Venaissin;" the Vivarais; the
Cevennes; the greater part of Languedoc and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> Gascony, with the important
cities of Montauban, Castres, Castelnaudary, Beziers, Pézénas,
Montpellier, Aiguesmortes, and Nismes.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In northern France alone,
where the number of Protestants was small, the Huguenots obtained but a
slight foothold.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Can iconoclasm be repressed?</div>

<p>In the midst of this universal movement there was one point in the
compact made by the confederates at Orleans, which it was found
impossible to execute. How could the churches, with their altars, their
statues, their pictures, their relics, their priestly vestments, be
guaranteed from invasion? To the Huguenot masses they were the temples
and instruments of an idolatrous worship. Ought Christians to tolerate
the existence of such abominations, even if sanctioned by the government?
It was hard to draw a nice line of distinction between the overthrow of
idolatry by public authority and by personal zeal. If there were any
difference in the merit of the act, it was in favor of the man who
vindicated the true religion at the risk of his own life. Nay, the Church
itself had incontrovertibly given its sanction to this view by placing
among the martyrs those primitive Christians who had upon their own
responsibility entered heathen temples and overthrown the objects of the
popular devotion. In those early centuries there had been manifested the
same reckless exposure of life, the same supreme contempt for the claims
of art in comparison with the demands of religion. The Minerva of Phidias
or Praxiteles was no safer from the iconoclastic frenzy of the new
convert from heathenism than the rude idol of a less cultivated age. The
command, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image," had not
excepted from its prohibition the marvellous products of the Greek
chisel.</p>

<p>It was here, therefore, that the chief insubordination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Huguenot
people manifested itself&mdash;not in licentious riot, not in bloodshed, not
in pillage. Calvin, with his high sense of law and order, might in his
letters reiterate the warnings against the irregularity which we have
seen him uttering on a previous occasion;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the ministers might
threaten the guilty with exclusion from the ordinances of the Church;
Condé might denounce the penalty of death. The people could not restrain
themselves or be restrained. They must remove what had been a
stumbling-block to them and might become a snare to others. They felt no
more compunction in breaking an image or tearing in pieces a picture,
than a traveller, whom a highwayman has wounded, is aware of, when he
destroys the weapons dropped by his assailant in his hurried flight.
Indeed, they experienced a strange satisfaction in visiting upon the
lifeless idol the punishment for the spiritual wrongs received at the
hands of false teachers of religion.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">It bursts out at Caen.</div>

<p>We have an illustration of the way in which the work of
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>molition was
accomplished in events occurring about this time at Caen. Two or three
inhabitants of this old Norman city were at Rouen when the churches were
invaded and sacked by an over-zealous crowd of sympathizers with the "new
doctrines." On their return to their native city, they began at once to
urge their friends to copy the example of the provincial capital. The
news reaching the ears of the magistrates of Caen, these endeavored&mdash;but
to no purpose, as the sequel proved&mdash;to calm the feverish pulse of the
people. On a Friday night (May eighth), the storm broke out, and it raged
the whole of the next day. Church, chapel, and monastery could testify to
its violence. Quaint windows of stained glass and rich old organs were
dashed in pieces. Saints' effigies, to employ the quaint expression of a
Roman Catholic eye-witness, "were massacred." "So great was the damage
inflicted, without any profit, that the loss was estimated at more than a
hundred thousand crowns." Still less excusable were the acts of vandalism
which the rabble&mdash;ever ready to join in popular commotions and always
throwing disgrace upon them&mdash;indulged. The beautiful tombs of William,
Duke of Normandy and conqueror of England, and of the Duchess-queen
Mathilda, the pride of Caen, which had withstood the ravages of nearly
five hundred years, were ruthlessly destroyed. The monument of Bishop
Charles of Martigny, who had been ambassador under Charles the Eighth and
Louis the Twelfth, shared the same fate. The zealous Roman Catholic who
relates these occurrences claims to have striven, although to no purpose,
to rescue the ashes of the conqueror from dispersion.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "idol" of Sainte Croix.</div>

<p>The contagion spread even to Orleans. Here, as in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> places where the
Huguenots had prevailed, there were but few of the inhabitants that had
not been drawn over to the reformed faith, or at least pretended to
embrace it. Yet Condé, in his desire to convince the world that no
partisan hatred moved him, strictly prohibited the intrusion of
Protestants into the churches, and assured the ecclesiastics of
protection so long as they chose to remain in the city. For a time,
consequently, their services continued to be celebrated in the presence
of the faithful few and with closed doors; but soon, their fears getting
the better of their prudence, the priests and monks one by one made their
retreat from the Protestant capital. On the twenty-first of April, word
was brought to Condé that some of the churches had been broken into
during the preceding night, and that the work of destruction was at that
very moment going forward in others. Hastening, in company with Coligny
and other leaders, to the spacious and imposing church of the Holy Rood
(Sainte Croix), he undertook, with blows and menaces, to check the
furious onslaught. Seeing a Huguenot soldier who had climbed aloft, and
was preparing to hurl from its elevated niche one of the saints that
graced the wall of the church, the prince, in the first ebullition of his
anger, snatched an arquebuse from the hands of one of his followers, and
aimed it at the adventurous iconoclast. The latter had seen the act, but
was in no wise daunted. Not desisting an instant from his pious
enterprise, "Sir," he cried to Condé, "have patience until I shall have
overthrown this idol; and then let me die, if that be your pleasure!"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The Huguenot soldier's fearless reply sounded the knell of many a sacred
painting and statue; for the destruction was accepted as God's work
rather than man's.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Henceforth little exertion was made to save these
objects of mistaken devotion, while the greatest care was taken to
prevent the robbery of the costly reliquaries and other precious
possessions of the churches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> of which inventories were drawn up, and
which were used only at the last extremity.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Massacre of Huguenots at Sens.</div>

<p>Far different in character from the bloodless "massacres" of images and
pictures in cities where the Huguenots gained the upper hand, were the
massacres of living men wherever the papists retained their superiority.
One of the most cruel and inexcusable was that which happened at Sens&mdash;a
city sixty-five or seventy miles toward the south-east from Paris&mdash;where,
on an ill-founded and malicious rumor that the reformed contemplated
rising and destroying their Roman Catholic neighbors, the latter, at the
instigation, it is said, of their archbishop, the Cardinal of Guise, and
encouraged by the violent example of Constable Montmorency at Paris,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
fell on the Protestants, murdered more than a hundred of both sexes and
of every age, and threw their dead bodies into the waters of the
Yonne.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> While these victims of a blind bigotry were floating on under
the windows of the Louvre toward the sea, Condé addressed to the queen
mother a letter of warm remonstrance, and called upon her to avenge the
causeless murder of so many innocent men and women; expressing the fear
that, if justice were denied by the king and by herself, the cry of
innocent blood would reach high heaven, and God would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> moved to
inflict those calamities with which the unhappy realm was every day
threatened.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>A few days before Condé penned this appeal, the English ambassador had
written and implored his royal mistress to seize the golden opportunity
to inspirit the frightened Catharine de' Medici, panic-stricken by the
violent measures of the Roman Catholic party; assuring her that "not a
day passed but that the Spanish ambassador, the Bishop of Rome, or some
other papist prince's minister put terror into the queen mother's
mind."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But Throkmorton's words and Cecil's entreaties were alike
powerless to induce Elizabeth to improve her advantage. The opportunity
was fast slipping by, and the calamities foretold by Condé were coming on
apace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disorders in Provence and Dauphiny.</div>

<p>In truth, few calamities could exceed in horror those that now befell
France. In the south-eastern corner of the kingdom, above all other
parts, civil war, ever prolific in evil passions, was already bearing its
legitimate fruits. For several years the fertile, sunny hills of Provence
and Dauphiny had enjoyed but little stable peace, and now both sides
caught the first notes of the summons to war and hurried to the fray.
Towns were stormed, and their inhabitants, whether surrendering on
composition or at the discretion of the conqueror, found little justice
or compassion. The men were more fortunate, in being summarily put to the
sword; the women were reserved for the vilest indignities, and then
shared the fate of their fathers and husbands. The thirst for revenge
caused the Protestant leaders and soldiers to perpetrate deeds of cruelty
little less revolting than those which disgraced the papal cause; but
there was, at least, this to be said in their favor, that not even their
enemies could accuse them of those infamous excesses of lewdness of which
their opponents were notoriously guilty.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Their vengeance was
satisfied with the lives, and did not demand the honor of the vanquished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The city of Orange.</div>

<p>The little city of Orange, capital of William of Nassau's principality,
contained a growing community of Protestants, whom the prince had in vain
attempted to restrain. About a year and a half before the outburst of the
civil war, William the Silent, then a sincere Roman Catholic,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> on
receiving complaints from the Pope, whose territories about Avignon&mdash;the
Comtât Venaissin&mdash;ran around three sides of the principality, had
expressed himself "<i>marvellously sorry</i> to see how those <i>wicked
heresies</i> were everywhere spreading, and that they had even penetrated
into his principality of Orange."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> And when he received tidings that
the Huguenots were beginning to preach, he had written to his governor
and council, "to see to it by all means in the world, that no alteration
be permitted in our true and ancient religion, and in no wise to consent
that those wicked men should take refuge in his principality." As
Protestantism advanced in Orange, he purposed to give instructions to use
persuasion and force, "in order to remedy a disorder so pernicious to all
Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> While he was unwilling to call in French troops, lest
he should prejudice his sovereign rights, he declared his desire to be
authorized to employ the pontifical soldiers in the work of
repression.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> But in spite of these restrictive measures, the reformed
population increased rather than diminished, and the bishop of the city
now called upon Fabrizio Serbelloni, a cousin of Pope Pius the Fourth,
and papal general at Avignon, to assist him by driving out the
Protestants, who, ever since the massacre of Vassy, had feared with good
reason the assault of their too powerful and hostile neighbors, and had
taken up arms in self-defence. They had not, however, apprehended so
speedy an attack as Serbelloni now made (on the fifth of June), and,
taken by surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> were able to make but a feeble resistance. The papal
troops entered the city through the breach their cannon had effected.
Never did victorious army act more insolently or with greater inhumanity.
None were spared; neither the sick on their beds, nor the poor in their
asylums, nor the maimed that hobbled through the streets. Those were most
fortunate that were first despatched. The rest were tortured with painful
wounds that prolonged their agonies till death was rather desired than
dreaded, or were hurled down upon pikes and halberds, or were hung to
pot-hooks and roasted in the fire, or were hacked in pieces. Not a few of
the women were treated with dishonor; the greater part were hung to doors
and windows, and their dead bodies, stripped naked, were submitted to
indignities for which the annals of warfare, except among the most
ferocious savages, can scarcely supply a parallel. That the Almighty
might not seem to be insulted in the persons only of living creatures
formed in His own image, the fresh impiety was perpetrated of derisively
stuffing leaves torn from French Bibles into the gaping wounds of the
dead lying on this field of carnage. Nor did the Roman Catholics of
Orange fare much better than their reformed neighbors. Mistaken for
enemies, they were massacred in the public square, where they had
assembled, expecting rather to receive a reward for their services in
assisting the pontifical troops to enter, than to atone for their
treachery by their own death.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">François de Beaumont, Baron des Adrets.</div>

<p>But the time for revenge soon came around. The barbarous warfare
initiated by the adherents of the triumvirate in Dauphiny and Provence
bred or brought forward a leader and soldiers who did not hesitate to
repay cruelty with cruelty. François de Beaumont, Baron des Adrets, was a
merciless general, who affected to believe that rigor and strict
retaliation were indispensable to remove the contempt in which the
Huguenots were held, and who knew how by bold movements to appear where
least expected, and by vigor to multiply the apparent size of his army.
Attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> Reformation only from ambition, and breathing a spirit
far removed from the meekness of the Gospel, he soon awakened the horror
of his comrades in arms, and incurred the censure of Condé for his
barbarities; so that, within a few months, becoming disgusted with the
Huguenots, he went over to the papal side, and in the second civil war
was found fighting against his former associates.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Meantime, his
brief connection with the Huguenots was a blot upon their escutcheon all
the more noticeable because of the prevailing purity;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and the injury
he inflicted upon the cause of Protestantism far more than cancelled the
services he rendered at Lyons and elsewhere. At Pierrelate he permitted
his soldiers to take signal vengeance on the garrison for the recent
massacre. At Mornas the articles of the capitulation, by which the lives
of the besieged were guaranteed, were not observed; for the Protestant
soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> from Orange, recognizing among them the perpetrators of the
crimes which had turned their homes into a howling desert, fell upon them
and were not&mdash;perhaps could not be&mdash;restrained by their leader.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The
fatal example of Orange was but too faithfully copied, and precipitating

execution.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Only one of the unfortunates, who happened to break his

auspices of such an officer, fierce passions should have had free play.
At Toulouse, the seat of the most fanatical parliament in France, a
notable massacre took place. Even in this hot-bed of bigotry the reformed
doctrines had made rapid and substantial progress, and the great body of
the students in the famous law-school, as well of the municipal
government, were favorable to their spread.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The common people,
however, were as virulent in their hostility as the parliament itself.
They had never been fully reconciled to the publication of the Edict of
January, and had only been restrained from interference with the worship
of the Protestants by the authority of the government. Of late the
Huguenots had discovered on what treacherous ground they stood. A funeral
procession of theirs had been attacked, and several persons had been
murdered. A massacre had been perpetrated in the city of Cahors, not far
distant from them. In both cases the entire authority of parliament had
been exerted to shield the guilty. The Huguenots, therefore, resolved to
forestall disaster by throwing Toulouse into the hands of Condé, and
succeeded so far as to introduce some companies of soldiers within the
walls and to seize the "hôtel de ville." They had, however, miscalculated
their strength. The Roman Catholics were more numerous, and after
repeated con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>flicts they were able to demand the surrender of the
building in which the Protestants had intrenched themselves. Destitute
alike of provisions and of the means of defence, and menaced with the
burning of their retreat, the latter accepted the conditions offered,
and&mdash;a part on the day before Pentecost, a part after the services of
that Sunday, one of the chief festivals of the Reformed Church&mdash;they
retired without arms, intending to depart for more hospitable cities.
Scarce, however, had the last detachment left the walls, when the tocsin
was sounded, and their enemies, respecting none of their promises,
involved them in a horrible carnage. It was the opinion of the best
informed that in all three thousand persons perished on both sides during
the riot at Toulouse, of whom by far the greater number were Huguenots.
Even this effusion of blood was not sufficient. The next day Montluc
appeared in the city. And now, encouraged by his support, the Parliament
of Toulouse initiated a system of judicial inquiries which were summary
in their character, and rarely ended save in the condemnation of the
accused. Within three months two hundred persons were publicly executed.
The Protestant leader was quartered. The parliament vindicated its
orthodoxy by the expulsion of twenty-two counsellors suspected of a
leaning to the Reformation; and informers were allured by bribes, as well
as frightened by ecclesiastical menaces, in order that the harvest of
confiscation might be the greater.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

to our times commemorated by centenary celebrations;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> such the pious

<div class="sidenote">Foreign alliances sought.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, about Paris and Orleans the war lagged. Both sides were
receiving reinforcements. The ban and rear-ban were summoned in the
king's name, and a large part of the levies joined Condé as the royal
representative in preference to Navarre and the triumvirate.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Charles

no means confident that the love of country of the French might not,
after all, prove stronger than the discord engendered by their religious

<div class="sidenote">Queen Elizabeth's aid invoked.</div>

<p>The Huguenots, on the other hand, had rather endeavored to set themselves
right in public estimation and to prepare the way for future calls for
assistance, than made any present requisitions. Elizabeth's ambassador,
Throkmorton, had been carefully instructed as to the danger that overhung
his mistress with all the rest of Protestant Christendom. He wrote to her
that the plot was a general one, including England. "It may please your
Majesty the papists, within these two days at Sens in Normandy, have
slain and hurt two hundred persons&mdash;men and women. Your Majesty may
perceive how dangerous it is to suffer papists that be of great heart and
enterprise to lift up their crests so high."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In another despatch he
warned her of her danger. "It standeth your Majesty upon, for the
conservation of your realm in the good terms it is in (thanks be to God),
to countenance the Protestants as much as you may, until they be set
afoot again, I mean in this realm; for here dependeth the great sway of
that matter."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Cecil's urgency and schemes.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Divided sympathies of the English.</div>

<p>Cecil himself adopted the same views, and urged them upon Elizabeth's
attention. Not succeeding in impressing her according to his wish, he
resorted to extraordinary measures to compass the end. He instructed
Mundt, his agent in Germany, to exert himself to induce the Protestant
princes to send "special messengers" to England and persuade Elizabeth to
join in "a confederacy of all parts professing the Gospel." In fact, the
cunning secretary of state went even farther, and dictated to Mundt just
what he should write to the queen. He was to tell her Majesty "that if
she did not attempt the furtherance of the Gospel in France, and the
keeping asunder of France and Spain, she would be in greater peril than
any other prince in Christendom," for "the papist princes that sought to
draw her to their parts meant her subversion"&mdash;a truth which, were she to
be informed of by any of the German princes, might have a salutary
effect.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But the vacillating queen could not be induced as yet to
take the same view, and needed the offer of some tangible advantages to
move her. No wonder that Elizabeth's policy halted. Every occurrence
across the channel was purposely misrepresented by the emissaries of
Philip, and the open sympathizers of the Roman Catholic party at the
English court were almost more numerous than the hearty Protestants. A
few weeks later, a correspondent of Throkmorton wrote to him from home:
"Here are daily bruits given forth by the Spanish ambassador, as it is
thought, far discrepant from such as I learn are sent from your lordship,
and the papists have so great a voice here as they have almost as much
credit, the more it is to be lamented. I have not, since I came last
over, come in any company where almost the greater part have not in
reasoning defended papistry, allowed the Guisians' proceedings, and
seemed to deface the prince's quarrel and design. How dangerous this is
your lordship doth see."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The Swiss Protestant cantons were reluctant
to appear to countenance rebellion. Berne sent a few ensigns to Lyons at
the request of the Protestants of that city, but wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> to limit them
strictly to the defensive, and subsequently she yielded to the urgency of
the Guises and recalled them altogether.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> But as yet no effort was
made by Condé to call in foreign assistance. The reluctance of Admiral
Coligny, while it did honor to the patriotism which always moved him,
seems to have led him to commit a serious mistake. The admiral hoped and
believed that the Huguenots would prove strong enough to succeed without
invoking foreign assistance; moreover, he was unwilling to set the first
example of bringing in strangers to arbitrate concerning the domestic
affairs of France.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> And, indeed, had his opponents been equally
patriotic, it is not improbable that his expectation would have been
realized. For, if inferior to the enemy in infantry, the Huguenots,
through the great preponderance of noblemen and gentlemen in their army,
were at first far superior in cavalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diplomatic man&oelig;uvres.</div>

<p>The beaten path of diplomatic man&oelig;uvre was first tried. Four times
were messengers sent to Condé, in the king's name, requiring his
submission. Four times he responded that he could not lay down his arms
until Guise should have retired from court and been punished for the
massacre of Vassy, until the constable and Saint André should have
returned to their governments, leaving the king his personal liberty, and
until the Edict of January should be fully re-established.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> These
demands the opposing party were unwilling to concede. It is true that a
pretence was made of granting the last point, and, on the eleventh of
April, an edict, ostensibly in confirmation of that of January, was
signed by Charles, by the advice of Catharine, the King of Navarre, the
Cardinals of Bourbon and Guise, the Duke of Guise, the constable, and
Aumale. But there was a glaring contradiction between the two laws, for
Paris was ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>pressly excepted from the provisions. In or around the
capital no exercises of the reformed religion could be celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
Such was the trick by which the triumvirs hoped to take the wind out of
the confederates' sails. Though the concession could not be accepted by
the Protestants, it might be alleged to show foreigners the
unreasonableness of Condé and his supporters. Meantime, in reply to the
prince's declaration as to the causes for which he had taken up arms, the
adherents of Guise published in their own vindication a paper, wherein
they gravely asserted that, but for the duke's timely arrival, fifteen
hundred Huguenots, gathered from every part of the kingdom, would have
entered Paris, and, with the assistance of their confederates within the
walls, would have plundered the city.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The month of May witnessed the dreary continuation of the same state of
things. On the first, Condé wrote to the queen mother, reiterating his
readiness to lay down the arms he had assumed in the king's defence and
her's, on the same conditions as before. On the fourth, Charles,
Catharine, and Antoine replied, refusing to dismiss the Guises or to
restore the Edict of January in reference to Paris, but, at the same
time, inviting the prince to return to court, and promising that, after
he should have submitted, and the revolted cities should have been
restored to their allegiance, the triumvirs would retire to their
governments.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>On the same day two petitions were presented to Charles. Both were signed
by Guise, Montmorency, and Saint André. In the first they prayed his
Majesty to interdict the exercise of every other religion save the "holy
Apostolic and Roman," and require that all royal officers should conform
to that religion or forfeit their positions; to compel the heretics to
restore the churches which had been destroyed; to punish the
sacrilegious; to declare rebels all who persisted in retaining arms
without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> permission of the King of Navarre. Under these conditions they
would consent, they said, to leave France&mdash;nay, to go to the ends of the
world. In the second petition they demanded the submission of the
confederates of Orleans, the restitution of the places which had been
seized, the exaction of an oath to observe the royal edicts, both new and
old, and the enforcement of the sole command of Navarre over the French
armies.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé's reply to the pretended petition.</div>

<p>Condé's reply (May twentieth) was the most bitter, as well as the ablest
and most vigorous paper of the initiatory stage of the war. It well
deserves a careful examination. The pretended <i>petition</i>, Louis of
Bourbon wrote to the queen mother, any one can see, even upon a cursory
perusal, to be in effect nothing else than a <i>decree</i> concocted by the
Duke of Guise, Constable Montmorency, and Marshal Saint André, with the
assistance of the papal legate and nuncio and the ministers of foreign
states. Ambition, not zeal for the faith, is the motive. In order to have
their own way, not only do the signers refuse to have a prince of the
blood near the monarch, but they intend removing and punishing all the
worthy members of the royal privy council, beginning with Michel de
l'Hospital, the chancellor. In point of fact, they have already made a
ridiculous appointment of six new counsellors. The queen mother is to be
banished to Chenonceaux, there to spend her time in laying out her
gardens. La Roche-sur-Yon will be sent elsewhere. New instructors are to
be placed around the king to teach him riding, jousting, the art of
love&mdash;anything, in short, to divert his mind from religion and the art of
reigning well. The conspiracy is more dangerous than the conspiracy of
Sulla or Cæsar, or that of the Roman triumvirs. Its authors point to
their titles, and allege the benefits they have conferred; but their
boasts may easily be answered by pointing to their insatiable avarice,
and to the princely revenues they have accumulated during their long
connection with the public administration. They speak of the present
dangerous state of the country. What was it before the massacre of Vassy?
After the publication of the Edict of January universal peace prevailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
That peace these very petitioners disturbed. What means the coalition of
the constable and Marshal Saint André? What mean the barbarities lately
committed in Paris, but that the peace was to be broken by violent means?
As to the obedience the petitioners profess to exhibit to the queen, they
showed her open contempt when they refused to go to the provinces which
they governed under the king's orders; when they came to the capital
contrary to her express direction, and that in arms; when by force they
dragged the king, her son, and herself from Fontainebleau to the Louvre.
They have accused the Huguenots of treating the king as a prisoner,
because these desire that the decree drawn up by the advice of the three
estates of the realm should be made irrevocable until the majority of
Charles the Ninth; but how was it when three persons, of whom one is a
foreigner and the other two are servants of the crown, dictate a <i>new</i>
edict, and wish that edict to be absolutely irrevocable? There is no need
of lugging the Roman Catholic religion into the discussion, and
undertaking its defence, for no one has thought of attacking it. The
demand made by the petitioners for a compulsory subscription to certain
articles of theirs is in opposition to immemorial usage; for no
subscription has ever been exacted save to the creed of the Apostles. It
is a second edict, and in truth nothing else than the introduction of
that hateful Spanish inquisition. Ten thousand nobles and a hundred
thousand soldiers will not be compelled either by force or by authority
to affix their signatures to it. But, to talk of enforcing submission to
a Roman Catholic confession is idle, so long as the Duke of Guise and the
Cardinal of Lorraine do not retract their own adhesion to the Augsburg
Confession lately given in with such protestations to a German prince.
The charge of countenancing the breaking of images the prince would
answer by pointing to the penalties he has inflicted in order to repress
the irregularity. And yet, if it come to the true desert of punishment,
what retribution ought not to be meted out for the crimes perpetrated by
the petitioners, or under their auspices and after their examples, at
Vassy, at Sens, at Paris, at Toulouse, and in so many other places? For
the author of the petition should have remembered that it is nowhere
written that a dead image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> ever cried for vengeance; but the blood of
man&mdash;God's living image&mdash;demands it of heaven, and draws it down, though
it tarry long. As for the accusation brought against Condé and the best
part of the French nobility, that they are rebels, the prince hopes soon
to meet his accusers in the open field and there decide the question
whether a foreigner and two others of such a station as they are shall
undertake to judge a prince of the blood. To allege Navarre's authority
comes with ill-grace from men who wronged that king so openly during the
late reign of Francis the Second. Finally, the Prince of Condé would set
over against the petition of the triumvirate, one of his own, containing
for its principal articles that the Edict of January, which his enemies
seek to overturn, shall be observed inviolate; that all the king's
subjects of every order and condition shall be maintained in their rights
and privileges; that the professors of the reformed faith shall be
protected until the majority of Charles; that arms shall be laid down on
either side; above all, that <i>foreign</i> arms, which he himself, so far
from inviting to France, has, up to the present moment, steadfastly
declined when voluntarily offered, and which he will never resort to
unless compelled by his enemies, shall be banished from the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Third National Synod.</div>

<p>While the clouds of war were thus gathering thick around Orleans, within
its walls a synod of the reformed churches of France had assembled on the
twenty-fifth of April, to deliberate of matters relating to their
religious interests. Important questions of discipline were discussed and
settled, and a day of public fasting and prayer was appointed in view of
the danger of a declared civil war.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Interview of Catharine and Condé.</div>

<p>The actual war was fast approaching. The army of the Guises, under the
nominal command of the King of Navarre, was now ready to march in the
direction of Orleans. Before setting out, however, the triumvirs resolved
to make sure of their hold upon the capital, and royal edicts (of the
twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh of May) were obtained ordering the
expulsion from Paris of all known Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Then, with an army of
four thousand foot and three thousand horse, the King of Navarre marched
toward the city of Châteaudun.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> On hearing of the movement of his
brother's forces, the Prince of Condé advanced to meet him at the head of
six thousand foot and two thousand horse. There were those, however, who
still believed it to be possible to avert a collision and settle the
matters in dispute by amicable discussion. Of this number was Catharine
de' Medici. Hastily leaving the castle of Vincennes, she hurried to the
front, and at the little town of Toury, between the two armies, she
brought about an interview between Condé, the King of Navarre, and
herself. Such was the imbittered feeling supposed to animate both sides,
that the escorts of the two princes had been strictly enjoined to avoid
approaching each other, lest they should be tempted to indulge in
insulting remarks, and from these come to blows. But, to the great
surprise of all, they had no sooner met than papist and Huguenot rushed
into each other's arms and embraced as friends long separated. While the
principals were discussing the terms of union, their followers had
already expressed by action the accord reigning in their hearts, and the
white cloaks of Condé's attendants were to be seen indiscriminately
mingled with the crimson cloaks of his brother's escort. Yet, after all,
the interview came to nothing. Neither side could accept the only terms
the other would offer, and Catharine returned disappointed to Paris, to
be greeted by the populace with the most insulting language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> for
imperilling the orthodoxy of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Not, however, altogether
despairing of effecting a reconciliation, Condé addressed a letter to the
King of Navarre, entreating him, before it should be too late, to listen
to his brotherly arguments. The answer came in a new summons to lay down
his arms.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "loan" of Beaugency.</div>

<p>Yet, while they had no desire for a reconciliation on any such terms as
the Huguenots could accept, there were some substantial advantages which
the Roman Catholic leaders hoped to reap under cover of fresh
negotiations. All the portion of the valley of the Loire lying nearest to
Paris was in the hands of the confederates of Orleans. It was impossible
for Navarre to reach the southern bank, except by crossing below Amboise,
and thus exposing the communications of his army with Paris to be cut off
at any moment. To attain his end with less difficulty, Antoine now sent
word to his brother that he was disposed to conclude a peace, and
proposed a truce of six days. Meanwhile, he requested Condé to gratify
him by the "loan" of the town of Beaugency, a few miles below Orleans,
where he might be more comfortably lodged than in his present
inconvenient quarters. The request was certainly sufficiently novel, but
that it was granted by Condé may appear even more strange.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Futile negotiations.</div>

<p>This was not the only act of folly in which the Huguenot leaders became
involved. Under pretence of showing their readiness to contribute their
utmost to the re-establishment of peace, the constable, Guise, and Saint
André, after obtaining a declaration from Catharine and Antoine that
their voluntary retreat would do no prejudice to their honor,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
retired from the royal court, but went no farther than the neighboring
city of Châteaudun. The Prince of Condé, swallowing the bait, did not
hesitate a moment to place himself, the very next day, in the hands of
the queen mother and his brother, and was led more like a captive than a
freeman from Beaugency to Talsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> where Catharine was staying. Becoming
alarmed, however, at his isolated situation, he wrote to his comrades in
arms, and within a few hours so goodly a company of knights appeared,
with Coligny, Andelot, Prince Porcien, La Rochefoucauld, Rohan, and other
distinguished nobles at their head, that any treacherous plans that may
have been entertained by the wily Italian princess were rendered entirely
futile. She resolved, therefore, to entrap them by soft speeches. With
that utter disregard for consistency so characteristic both of her
actions and of her words, Catharine publicly<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> thanked the Huguenot
lords for the services they had rendered the king, who would never cease
to be grateful to them, and recognized, for her own part, that her son
and she herself owed to them the preservation of their lives. But, after
this flattering preamble, she proceeded to make the unpalatable
proposition that they should consent to the repeal of the edict so far as
Paris was concerned, under the guarantee of personal liberty, but without
permission to hold public religious worship. The prince and his
associates could listen to no such terms. Indeed, carried away by the
fervor of their zeal, they protested that, rather than surrender the
rights of their brethren, they would leave the kingdom. "We shall
willingly go into exile," they said, "if our absence will conduce to the
restoration of public tranquillity." This assurance was just what
Catharine had been awaiting. To the infinite surprise of the speakers
themselves, she told them that she appreciated their disinterested
motives, and accepted their offer; that they should have safe-conducts to
whatever land they desired to visit, with full liberty to sell their
goods and to receive their incomes; but that their voluntary retirement
would last only until the king's majority, which would be declared so
soon as he had completed his fourteenth year!<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It needs scarcely be
said that, awkward as was the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>dicament in which they had placed
themselves, the prince and his companions had little disposition to
follow out Catharine's plan. On their return to the Protestant camp, the
clamor of the soldiers against any further exposure of the person of
their leader to peril, and the opportune publication of an intercepted
letter said to have been written by the Duke of Guise to his brother, the
Cardinal of Lorraine, on the eve of his departure for Châteaudun, and
disclosing treacherous designs,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> decided the Huguenot leaders to
break off the negotiations.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The long period of comparative inaction was now succeeded by a spasmodic
effort at energetic conduct. The six days' truce had scarcely expired
when the prince resolved to throw himself unexpectedly upon the
neighboring camp of the Roman Catholics, before Montmorency, Guise, and
Saint André had resumed their accustomed posts. One of those nocturnal
attacks, which, under the name of <i>camisades</i>, figure so frequently in
the military history of the period, was secretly organized, and the
Protestant soldiers, wearing white shirts over their armor, in order that
they might easily recognize each other in the darkness of the night,
started with alacrity, under D'Andelot's command, on the exciting
adventure. But their guides were treacherous, or unskilful, and the
enterprise came to naught.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Disappointed in this attempt, and unable
to force the enemy to give battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> Condé turned his attention to
Beaugency, which the King of Navarre had failed to restore, and carried
it by storm. He would gladly have followed up the advantage by laying
siege to Blois and Tours, which the triumvirate had taken and treated
with the utmost cruelty; but heavy rains, and the impossibility of
carrying on military operations on account of the depth of the mud,
compelled him to relinquish his project, and reduced the main army to
renewed inactivity.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The protracted delays and inexcusable sluggishness of the leaders had
borne their natural fruits. Many of the Protestant gentlemen had left the
camp in disgust at the mistakes committed; others had retired to their
homes on hearing that their families were exposed to the dangers of war
and stood in need of their protection; a few had been corrupted by the
arts of the enemy. For it was a circumstance often noticed by
contemporaries, that no envoy was ever sent from Orleans to the court who
did not return, if not demoralized, yet so lukewarm as to be incapable of
performing any good service in future.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Yet the dispersion of the
higher rank of the reformed soldiers, and the consequent weakening of
Condé's army in cavalry, were attended with this incidental advantage,
that they contributed greatly to the strengthening of the party in the
provinces, and necessitated a similar division of the opposing
forces.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot discipline.</div>

<p>Never, perhaps, was there an army that exhibited such excellent
discipline as did the army of the Protestants in this the first stage of
its warfare. Never had the morals and religion of soldiers been better
cared for. It was the testimony of a soldier, one of the most
accomplished and philosophical writers of his times&mdash;the brave "Bras de
Fer"&mdash;that the preaching of the Gospel was the great instrument of
imbu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>ing the army with the spirit of order. Crimes, he tells us, were
promptly revealed; no blasphemy was heard throughout the camp, for it was
universally frowned upon. The very implements of gambling&mdash;dice and
cards&mdash;were banished. There were no lewd women among the camp-followers.
Thefts were unfrequent and vigorously punished. A couple of soldiers were
hung for having robbed a peasant of a small quantity of wine.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Public
prayers were said morning and evening; and, instead of profane or
indelicate songs, nothing was heard but the psalms of David. Such were
the admirable fruits of the careful discipline of Admiral Coligny, the
true leader of the Protestant party; and they made a deep impression upon
such enthusiastic youths as François de la Noue and Téligny. Their more
experienced author, however, was not imposed upon by these flattering
signs. "It is a very fine thing," he told them, "if only it last; but I
much fear that these people will spend all their goodness at the outset,
and that, two months hence, nothing will remain but malice. I have long
commanded infantry, and I know that it often verifies the proverb which
says: '<i>Of a young hermit, an old devil!</i>' If this army does not, we
shall give it a good mark."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The prediction was speedily realized;
for, although the army of the prince never sought to rival the papal
troops in the extent of its license, the standard of soldierly morality
was far below that which Coligny had desired to establish.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Severities of the parliament.</div>

<p>So far as cruelty was concerned, everything in the conduct of their
antagonists was calculated to provoke the Protestants to bitter
retaliation. The army of Guise was merciless. If the infuriated Huguenots
selected the priests that fell into their hands for the especial
monuments of their retribution, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> was because the priesthood as a body
had become the instigators of savage barbarity, instead of being the
ministers of peace; because when they did not, like Ronsard the poet,
themselves buckle on the sword, or revel in blood, like the monks of
Saint Calais,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> they still fanned, as they had for years been fanning,
the flame of civil war, denouncing toleration or compromise, wielding the
weapons of the church to enforce the pious duty of exterminating every
foul calumny invented to the disadvantage of the reformers. No wonder,
then, that the ecclesiastical dress itself became the badge of deadly and
irreconcilable hostility, and that in the course of this unhappy war many
a priest was cut down without any examination into his private views or
personal history. Parliament, too, was setting the example of cruelty by
reckless orders amounting almost to independent legislation. By a series
of "arrêts" succeeding each other rapidly in the months of June and July,
the door was opened wider and wider for popular excess. When the churches
of Meaux were visited by an iconoclastic rabble on the twenty-sixth of
June, the Parisian parliament, on the thirtieth of June, employed the
disorder as the pretext of a judicial "declaration" that made the
culprits liable to all the penalties of treason, and permitted any one to
put them to death without further authorization. The populace of Paris
needed no fuller powers to attack the Huguenots, for, within two or three
days, sixty men and women had been killed, robbed, and thrown into the
river. Parliament, therefore, found it convenient to terminate the
massacre by a second order restricting the application of the declaration
to persons taken in the very act.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> A few days later (July, 1562),
other arrêts empowered all inhabitants of towns and villages to take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
arms against those who molested priests, sacked churches, or "held
conventicles and unlawful assemblies," whether public or secret; and to
arrest the ministers, deacons, and other ecclesiastical functionaries for
trial, as guilty of treason against God as well as man.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Not content
with these appeals to popular passion,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> however, the Parisian judges
soon gave practical exemplifications of their intolerant principles; for
two royal officers&mdash;the "lieutenant general" of Pontoise, and the
"lieutenant" of Senlis&mdash;were publicly hung; the former for encouraging
the preaching of God's word "in other form than the ancient church"
authorized, the latter for "celebrating the Lord's Supper according to
the Genevese fashion." These were, according to the curate of St.
Barthélemi, the first executions at Paris for the simple profession of
"Huguenoterie" since the pardon proclaimed by Francis the Second at
Amboise.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> A few days later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> a new and more explicit declaration
pronounced all those who had taken up arms, robbed churches and
monasteries, and committed other sacrilegious acts at Orleans, Lyons,
Rouen, and various other cities mentioned by name, to be rebels, and
deprived them of all their offices. Yet, by way of retaliation upon Condé
for maintaining that he had entered upon the war in order to defend the
persons of the king and his mother, unjustly deprived of their liberty,
parliament pretended to regard the prince himself as an unwilling captive
in the hands of the confederates; and, consequently, excepted him alone
from the general attainder.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> But the legal fiction does not seem to
have been attended with the great success its projectors
anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The people could scarcely credit the statement that the
war was waged by the Guises simply for the liberation of their mortal
enemy, Condé, especially when Condé himself indignantly repelled the
attempt to separate him from the associates with whom he had entered into
common engagements, not to add that the reputation of the Lorraine
family, whose mouthpiece parliament might well be supposed to be, was not
over good for strict adherence to truth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the triumvirs were more successful in their military operations
than the partisans of the prince. Their auxiliaries came in more
promptly, for the step which Condé now saw himself forced to take, in
consequence of his opponents' course, they had long since resolved upon.
They had received reinforcements from Germany, both of infantry and
cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> under command of the Rhinegrave Philip of Salm and the Count of
Rockendorf; while Condé had succeeded in detaching but few of the
Lutheran troopers by a manifesto in which he endeavored to explain the
true nature of the struggle. Soldiers from the Roman Catholic cantons had
been allowed a free passage through the Spanish Franche-Comté by the
regent of the Low Countries, Margaret of Parma. The Pope himself
contributed liberally to the supply of money for paying the troops.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
But the Protestant reinforcements from the Palatinate and Zweibrücken
(Deux-Ponts), and from Hesse, which D'Andelot, and, after him, Gaspard de
Schomberg, had gone to hasten, were not yet ready; while Elizabeth still
hesitated to listen to the solicitations of Briquemault and Robert
Stuart, the Scotchman, who had been successively sent to her court.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Military successes of the triumvirs.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Bourges.</div>

<p>After effecting the important capture of the city of Poitiers, Marshal
Saint André, at the head of a Roman Catholic army, had marched, about the
middle of August, toward Bourges, perhaps the most important place held
by the Protestants in central France. Beneath the walls of this city he
joined the main army, under Navarre's nominal command, but really led by
the Duke of Guise. The siege was pressed with vigor, for the king was
present in person with the "Guisards." To the handful of Huguenots their
assailants appeared to be "a marvellous army of French, Germans, reiters,
Spaniards, and other nations, numbering in all eighty or a hundred
thousand men, with the bravest cavalry that could be seen."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> And,
when twenty or twenty-five cannon opened upon Bourges with balls of forty
or fifty pounds' weight, and when six hundred and forty discharges were
counted on a single day, and every building in the town was shaken to its
very foundations, the besieged, numbering only a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> men, would
have been excusable had they lost heart. Instead of this, they
obstinately defended their works, repaired the breach by night, and
inflicted severe injury on the enemy by nocturnal sallies. To add to the
duke's embarrassment, Admiral Coligny, issuing from Orleans, was
fortunate enough to cut off an important convoy of provisions and
ammunition coming from Paris to the relief of the besiegers.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Despairing of taking the city by force, they now turned to negotiation.
Unhappily, M. d'Ivoy, in command of the Huguenot garrison, was not proof
against the seductive offers made him. Disregarding the remonstrances of
his companions in arms, who pointed to the fact that the enemy had from
day to day, through discouragement or from sheer exhaustion, relaxed
their assaults, he consented (on the thirty-first of August) to surrender
Bourges to the army that had so long thundered at its gates. D'Ivoy
returned to Orleans, but Condé, accusing him of open perfidy, refused to
see him; while the Protestants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> Bourges shared the usual fate of those
who trusted the promises of the Roman Catholic leaders, and secured few
of the religious privileges guaranteed by the articles of
capitulation.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>With the fall of Bourges, the whole of central France, as far as to the
gates of Orleans, yielded to the arms of Guise. Everywhere the wretched
inhabitants of the reformed faith were compelled to submit to gross
indignities, or seek safety in flight. To many of these homeless
fugitives the friendly castle of Montargis, belonging to the Duchess of
Ferrara, to which reference will shortly be made, afforded a welcome
refuge.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Help from Queen Elizabeth.</div>

<p>The necessity of obtaining immediate reinforcements had at length brought
Condé and the other great Huguenot lords to acquiesce in the offer of the
only terms upon which Elizabeth of England could be persuaded to grant
them actual support. As the indispensable condition to her interference,
she demanded that the cities of Havre and Dieppe should be placed in her
hands. These would be a pledge for the restoration of Calais, that old
English stronghold which had fallen into the power of the French during
the last war, and for whose restoration within eight years there had been
an express stipulation in the treaties Cateau-Cambrésis. This humiliating
concession the Huguenots reluctantly agreed to make. Elizabeth in turn
promised to send six thousand English troops (three thousand to guard
each of the cities), who should serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> under the command of Condé as the
royal lieutenant, and pledged her word to lend the prince and his
associates one hundred and forty thousand crowns toward defraying the
expenses of the war.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> On the twentieth of September the Queen of
England published to the world a declaration of the motives that led her
to interfere, alleging in particular the usurpation of the royal
authority by the Guises, and the consequent danger impending over the
Protestants of Normandy through the violence of the Duke of Aumale.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The tidings of the alliance and of some of its conditions had already
reached France, and they rather damaged than furthered the Protestant
cause. As the English queen's selfish determination to confine her
assistance to the protection of the three cities became known, it alarmed
even her warmest friends among the French Protestants. Condé and Coligny
earnestly begged the queen's ambassador to tell his mistress that "in
case her Majesty were introduced by their means into Havre, Dieppe, and
Rouen with six thousand men, only to keep those places, it would be unto
them a great note of infamy." They would seem wantonly to have exposed to
a foreign prince the very flower of Normandy, in giving into her hands
cities which they felt themselves quite able to defend without
assistance. So clearly did Throkmorton foresee the disastrous
consequences of this course, that, even at the risk of offending the
queen by his presumption, he took the liberty to warn her that if she
suffered the Protestants of France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> to succumb, with minds so alienated
from her that they should consent to make an accord with the opposite
faction, the possession of the cities would avail her but little against
the united forces of the French. He therefore suggested that it might be
quite as well for her Majesty's interests, "that she should serve the
turn of the Huguenots as well as her own."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Truly, Queen Elizabeth
was throwing away a glorious opportunity of displaying magnanimous
disinterestedness, and of conciliating the affection of a powerful party
on the continent. In the inevitable struggle between Protestant England
and papal Spain, the possession of such an ally as the best part of
France would be of inestimable value in abridging the contest or in
deciding the result. But the affection of the Huguenots could be secured
by no such cold-blooded compact as that which required them to appear in
the light of an unpatriotic party whose success would entail the
dismemberment of the kingdom. To make such a demand at the very moment
when her own ambassador was writing from Paris that the people "did daily
most cruelly use and kill every person, no age or sex excepted, that they
took to be contrary to their religion," was to show but too clearly that
not religious zeal nor philanthropic tenderness of heart, so much as pure
selfishness, was the motive influencing her.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> And yet the English
queen was not uninformed of, nor wholly insensible to, the calls of
humanity. She could in fact, on occasion, herself set them forth with
force and pathos. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> could surpass the sympathy expressed in her
autograph letter to Mary of Scots, deprecating the resentment of the
latter at Elizabeth's interference&mdash;a letter which, as Mr. Froude
notices, was not written by Cecil and merely signed by the queen, but was
her own peculiar and characteristic composition. "Far sooner," she wrote,
"would I pass over those murders on land; far rather would I leave
unwritten those noyades in the rivers&mdash;those men and women hacked in
pieces; but the shrieks of the strangled wives, great with child&mdash;the
cries of the infants at their mothers' breasts&mdash;pierce me through. What
drug of rhubarb can purge the bile which these tyrannies engender?"<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The news of the English alliance, although not unexpected, produced a
very natural irritation at the French court. When Throkmorton applied to
Catharine de' Medici for a passport to leave the kingdom, the queen
persistently refused, telling him that such a document was unnecessary in
his case. But she significantly volunteered the information that "some of
his nation had lately entered France without asking for passports, who
she hoped would speedily return without leave-taking!"<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Rouen, October.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the English movement rather accelerated than retarded the
operations of the royal army. After the fall of Bourges, there had been a
difference of opinion in the council whether Orleans or Rouen ought first
to be attacked. Orleans was the centre of Huguenot activity, the heart
from which the currents of life flowed to the farthest extremities of
Gascony and Languedoc; but it was strongly fortified, and would be
defended by a large and intrepid garrison. A siege was more likely to
terminate disastrously to the assailants than to the citizens and
Protestant troops. The admiral laughed at the attempt to attack a city
which could throw three thousand men into the breach.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Rouen, on the
contrary, was weak, and, if attacked before reinforcements were received
from England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> but feebly garrisoned. Yet it was the key of the valley of
the Seine, and its possession by the Huguenots was a perpetual menace of
the capital.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> So long as it was in their hands, the door to the heart
of the kingdom lay wide open to the united army of French and English
Protestants. Very wisely, therefore, the Roman Catholic generals
abandoned their original design<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> of reducing Orleans so soon as
Bourges should fall, and resolved first to lay siege to Rouen. Great
reason, indeed, had the captors of such strongholds as Marienbourg,
Calais, and Thionville, to anticipate that a place so badly protected, so
easily commanded, and destitute of any fortification deserving the name,
would yield on the first alarm.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It was true that a series of attacks
made by the Duke of Aumale upon Fort St. Catharine, the citadel of Rouen,
had been signally repulsed, and that, after two weeks of fighting, on the
twelfth of July he had abandoned the undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> But, with the more
abundant resources at their command, a better result might now be
expected. Siege was, therefore, a second time laid, on the twenty-ninth
of September, by the King of Navarre.</p>

<p>The forces on the two sides were disproportionate. Navarre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> Montmorency,
and Guise were at the head of sixteen thousand foot and two thousand
horse, in addition to a considerable number of German mercenaries.
Montgomery,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> who commanded the Protestants, had barely eight hundred
trained soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The rest of the scanty garrison was composed of
those of the citizens who were capable of bearing arms, to the number of
perhaps four thousand more. But this handful of men instituted a stout
resistance. After frequently repulsing the assailants, the double fort of
St. Catharine, situated near the Seine, on the east of the city, and
Rouen's chief defence, was taken rather by surprise than by force. Yet,
after this unfortunate loss, the brave Huguenots fought only with the
greater desperation. Their numbers had been reinforced by the accession
of some five hundred Englishmen of the first detachment of troops which
had landed at Havre on the third of October, and whom Sir Adrian Poynings
had assumed the responsibility of sending to the relief of the
beleaguered capital of Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> With Killigrew of Pendennis for
their captain, they had taken advantage of a high tide to pass the
obstructions of boats filled with stone and sand that had been sunk in
the river opposite Caudebec, and, with the exception of the crew of one
barge that ran ashore, and eleven of whom were hung by the Roman
Catholics, "for having entered the service of the Huguenots contrary to
the will of the Queen of England," they succeeded in reaching Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>These, however, were not the only auxiliaries upon whom the Huguenot
chief could count. The women were inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> with a courage that equalled,
and a determination that surpassed, that of their husbands and brothers.
They undertook the most arduous labors; they fought side by side on the
walls; they helped to repair at night the breaches which the enemy's
cannon had made during the day; and after one of the most sanguinary
conflicts during the siege, it was found that there were more women
killed and wounded than men. Yet the courage of the Huguenots sustained
them throughout the unequal struggle. Frequently summoned to surrender,
the Rouenese would listen to no terms that included a loss of their
religious liberty. Rather than submit to the usurpation of the Guises,
they preferred to fall with arms in their hands.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> For fall they must.
D'Andelot was on his way with the troops he had laboriously collected in
Germany; another band of three thousand Englishmen was only detained by
the adverse winds; Condé himself was reported on his way northward to
raise the siege&mdash;but none could arrive in time. The King of Navarre had
been severely wounded in the shoulder, but Guise and the constable
pressed the city with no less decision. At last the walls on the side of
the suburbs of St. Hilaire and Martainville were breached by the
overwhelming fire of the enemy. The population of Rouen and its motley
garrison, reduced in numbers, worn out with toils and vigils, and
disheartened by a combat which ceased on one day only to be renewed under
less favorable circumstances on the next, were no longer able to continue
their heroic and almost superhuman exertions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of Rouen.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Norman parliament.</div>

<p>On Monday, the twenty-sixth of October, the army of the triumvirate
forced its way over the rubbish into Rouen, and the richest city of
France, outside of Paris, fell an unresisting prey to the cupidity of an
insubordinate soldiery. Rarely had so tempting a prize fallen into the
hands of a conquering army; rarely were the exactions of war more
remorsely inflicted.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> But the barbarities of a licentious army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> were
exceeded in atrocity by the cooler deliberations of the Norman
parliament. That supreme court, always inimical to the Protestants, had
retired to the neighboring city of Louviers, in order to maintain itself
free from Huguenot influence. It now returned to Rouen and exercised a
sanguinary revenge. Augustin Marlorat, one of the most distinguished
among the reformed ministers of France, and the most prominent pastor of
the church of Rouen, had been thrown into prison; he was now brought
before the parliament, and with others was sentenced to death as a
traitor and a disturber of the public repose, then dragged on a hurdle to
the place of execution and ignominiously hung.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The ferocity of the Norman parliament alarming the queen mother, she
interfered to secure the observance of the edict of amnesty she had
recently prepared. But serious results followed in the case of two
prominent partisans of Guise who had fallen into Condé's hands, and were
in prison when the tidings reached Orleans. On the recommendation of his
council, the prince retaliated by sending to the gallows Jean Baptiste
Sapin, a member of the Parisian parliament, and the Abbé de Gastines, who
had been captured while travelling in company with an envoy whom the
court were sending to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre.</div>

<p>The fall of Rouen was followed within a few weeks by the death of the
King of Navarre. His painful wound was not, perhaps, necessarily mortal,
but the restless and vainglorious prince would not remain quiet and allow
it to heal. He insisted on being borne in a litter through the breach
into the city which had been taken under his nominal command. It was a
sort of triumphal procession, marching to the sound of cymbals, and with
other marks of victory. But the idle pageant only increased the
inflammation in his shoulder. Even in his sick-room he allowed himself no
time for serious thought; but, prating of the orange-groves of Sardinia
which he was to receive from the King of Spain, and toying with Rouhet,
the beautiful maid of honor by whom Catharine had drawn him into her net,
he frittered away the brief remnant of an ignoble life. When visibly
approaching his end, he is said, at the suggestion of an Italian
physician, to have confessed himself to a priest, and to have received
the last sacraments of the Romish Church. Yet, with characteristic
vacillation he listened, but a few hours later, with attention and
apparent devoutness, to the reading of God's Word, and answered the
remonstrances of his faithful Huguenot physician by the assurance that,
if he recovered his health, he would openly espouse the Augsburg
Confession, and cause the pure Gospel to be preached everywhere
throughout France.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> His death occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> on the seventeenth of
November, 1562, at Les Andelys, a village on the Seine. He had insisted,
contrary to his friends' advice, upon being taken by boat from Rouen to
St. Maur-des-Fossés, where, within a couple of leagues of Paris, he hoped
to breathe a purer air; but death overtook him before he had completed
half his journey.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Had Antoine embraced with sincerity and steadfastly maintained either of
the two phases of religious belief which divided between them the whole
of western Christendom, his death would have left a void which could have
been filled with difficulty. He was the first prince of the blood, and
entitled to the regency. His appearance was prepossessing, his manners
courteous. He was esteemed a capable general, and was certainly not
destitute of administrative ability. If, with hearty devotion, he had
given himself to the reformed views, the authority of his great name and
eminent position might have secured for their adherents, if not triumph,
at least toleration and quiet. But two capital weaknesses ruined his
entire course. The love of empty glory blinded him to his true interests;
and the love of sensual pleasure made him an easy dupe. He was robbed of
his legitimate claims to the first rank in France by the promise of a
shadowy sceptre in some distant region, which every sensible statesman of
his time knew from the first that Philip the Second never had entertained
the slightest intention of conferring; while, by the siren voices of her
fair maids of honor, Catharine de' Medici was always sure of being able
to lure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> him on to the most humiliating concessions. Deceived by the
emissaries of the Spanish king and the Italian queen mother, Antoine
would have been an object rather of pity than of disgust, had he not
himself played false to the friends who supported him. As it was, he
passed off the stage, and scarcely left a single person to regret his
departure. Huguenots and papists were alike gratified when the world was
relieved of so signal an example of inconstancy and perfidy.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Antoine
left behind him his wife, the eminent Jeanne d'Albret, and two
children&mdash;a son, the Prince of Béarn, soon to appear in history as the
leader of the Huguenot party, and, on the extinction of the Valois line,
to succeed to the throne as Henry the Fourth; and a daughter, Catharine,
who inherited all her mother's signal virtues. The widow and her children
were, at the time of Antoine's death, in Jeanne's dominions on the
northern slopes of the Pyrenees, whither they had retired when he had
first openly gone over to the side of the Guises. There, in the midst of
her own subjects, the Queen of Navarre was studying, more intelligently
than any other monarch of her age, the true welfare of her people, while
training her son in those principles upon which she hoped to see him lay
the foundations of a great and glorious career.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English in Havre.</div>

<p>The sagacity of the enemy had been well exhibited in the vigor with which
they had pressed the siege of Rouen. Condé, with barely seven thousand
men, had several weeks before shut himself up in Orleans, after
despatching the few troops at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> disposal for the relief of Bourges and
Rouen, and could do nothing beyond making his own position secure, while
impatiently awaiting the long-expected reinforcements from England and
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The dilatoriness that marked the entire conduct of the war
up to this time had borne its natural fruit in the gradual diminution and
dispersion of his forces, in the loss of one important city after
another, and almost of entire provinces, and, worst of all, in the
discouragement pervading all classes of the Huguenot population.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
Now, however, he was on the eve of obtaining relief. Two days after the
fall of Rouen, on the twenty-eighth of October, a second detachment of
the English fleet succeeded in overcoming the contrary winds that had
detained them ten days in crossing the channel, and landed three thousand
troops at the port of Havre.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> D'Andelot had finally been able to
gather up his German "reiters" and "lansquenets,"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and was making a
brilliant march through Alsace, Lorraine, Burgundy, and Champagne,
skilfully avoiding the enemy's forces sent out to watch and intercept
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> On the sixth of November, he presented himself before the
gates of Orleans, and was received with lively enthusiasm by the prince
and his small army.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Now at length, on the seventh of November, Condé could leave the walls
which for seven months had sheltered him in almost complete inaction, and
within which a frightful pestilence had been making havoc among the
flower of the chivalry of France; for, whilst fire and sword were
everywhere laying waste the country, heaven had sent a subtle and still
more destructive foe to decimate the wretched inhabitants. Orleans had
not escaped the scourge. The city was crowded with refugees from Paris
and from the whole valley of the Loire. Among these strangers, as well as
among the citizens, death found many victims. In a few months it was
believed that ten thousand persons perished in Orleans alone; while in
Paris, where the disease raged more than an entire year, the number of
deaths was much larger.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé takes the field.</div>

<p>With the four thousand lansquenets and the three thousand reiters brought
him from Germany,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Condé was able to leave a force, under command of
D'Andelot, sufficient to defend the city of Orleans, and himself to take
the field with an army of about fifteen thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> "Our
enemies,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> he said, "have inflicted two great losses upon us in taking
our castles"&mdash;meaning Bourges and Rouen&mdash;"but I hope that now we shall
have their knights, if they move out upon the board."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>As he was leaving Orleans, he was waited upon by a deputation of fifty
reformed ministers, who urged him to look well to the discipline and
purity of the army. They begged him, by salutary punishment, to banish
from the camp theft and rapine, and, above all, that more insidious and
heaven-provoking sin of licentiousness, which, creeping in, had doubtless
drawn down upon the cause such marked signs of the Lord's displeasure,
that, of all the congregations in France, only the churches of a few
islands on the coasts, and the churches of Montauban, Havre, Orleans,
Lyons, and of the cities of Languedoc<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> and Dauphiny, continued to
rear their heads through the storm that had prostrated all the rest; and,
to this end, they warned him by no means to neglect to afford his
soldiers upon the march the same opportunities of hearing God's Word and
of public prayer which they had enjoyed in Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p><p>The Huguenot army directed its course northward, and the different
divisions united under the walls of Pluviers, or Pithiviers, a weak
place, which surrendered after six hours of cannonading, with little loss
to the besieging party. The greater part of the garrison was dismissed
unharmed, after having been compelled to give up its weapons. Two of the
officers, as guilty of flagrant breach of faith and other crimes, were
summarily hung.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> And here the Huguenot cause was stained by an act of
cruelty for which no sufficient excuse can be found. Several Roman
Catholic priests, detected, in spite of their disguise, among the
prisoners, were put to death, without other pretext save that they had
been the chief instigators of the resistance which the town had offered.
Unhappily, the Huguenot regarded the priest, and the Roman Catholic the
reformed minister, as the guilty cause of the civil war, and thought it
right to vent upon his head the vengeance which his own religion should
have taught him to leave to the righteous retribution of a just God.
After the fall of Pithiviers, no resistance was attempted by Étampes and
other slightly garrisoned places of the neighborhood, the soldiers and
the clergy taking refuge, before the approach of the army, in the
capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prince appears before Paris.</div>

<p>The prince was now master of the country to the very gates of Paris, and
it was the opinion of many, including among them the reformer, Beza, that
the city itself might be captured by a sudden advance, and the war thus
ended at a blow.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> They therefore recommended that, without delay, the
army should hasten forward and attack the terrified inhabitants before
Guise and the constable should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> time to bring the army and the king
back from Normandy, where they still lingered. The view was so plausible,
indeed, that it was adopted by most of the reformed historians, and,
being indorsed by later writers, has caused the failure to march directly
against the capital to be regarded as a signal error of Condé in this
campaign. But it would certainly appear hazardous to adopt this
conclusion in the face of the most skilful strategists of the age. It has
already been seen that François de la Noue, one of the ablest generals of
whom the Huguenots could ever boast, regarded the idea of capturing Paris
at the beginning of the struggle, with the comparatively insignificant
forces which the prince could bring to the undertaking, as the most
chimerical that could be entertained. Was it less absurd now, when, if
the Protestant army had received large accessions, the walls of Paris
could certainly be held by the citizens for a few days, until an army of
fully equal size, under experienced leaders, could be recalled from the
lower Seine? Such, at least, was the conclusion at which Admiral Coligny,
the commanding spirit in the council-chamber and the virtual head of the
Huguenot army, arrived, when he calmly considered the perils of
attacking, with twelve or fifteen thousand men and four pieces of
artillery, the largest capital of continental Europe&mdash;a city whose
population amounted to several hundred thousand souls, among whom there
was now not a single avowed Protestant, and whose turbulent citizens were
not unaccustomed to the use of arms. He resolved, therefore, to adopt the
more practicable plan of making the city feel the pressure of the war by
cutting off its supplies of provisions and by ravaging the surrounding
country. Thus, Paris&mdash;"the bellows by whose blasts the war was kept in
flames," and "the kitchen that fed it"&mdash;would at last become weary of
sustaining in idleness an insolent soldiery, and of seeing its villages
given over to destruction, and compel the king's advisers to offer just
terms of peace, or to seek a solution of the present disputes on the open
field.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p><p>But, whatever doubt may be entertained respecting the propriety of the
plan of the campaign adopted by the Prince of Condé, there can be none
respecting the error committed in not promptly carrying that plan into
execution. The army loitered about Étampes instead of pressing on and
seizing the bridges across the Seine. Over these it ought to have
crossed, and, entering the fruitful district of Brie, to have become
master of the rivers by which the means of subsistence were principally
brought to Paris. With Corbeil and Lagny in his possession, Condé would
have held Paris in as deadly a grasp as Henry the Fourth did twenty-eight
years later, when Alexander of Parma was forced to come from Flanders to
its assistance.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> When, at last, the Huguenot army took the direction
of Corbeil, commanding one of the bridges, the news arrived of the death
of Antoine of Navarre. And with this intelligence came fresh messengers
from Catharine, who had already endeavored more than once by similar
means to delay the Huguenots in their advance. She now strove to amuse
Condé with the hope of succeeding his brother as lieutenant-general of
the kingdom during Charles's minority.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>In vain did the soldiers chafe at this new check upon their en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>thusiasm,
in vain did prudent counsellors remonstrate. There was a traitor even in
the prince's council, in the person of Jean de Hangest, sieur de Genlis
(brother of D'Ivoy, the betrayer of Bourges), whose open desertion we
shall soon have occasion to notice, and this treacherous adviser was
successful in procuring a delay of four days.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The respite was not
thrown away. Before the Huguenots were again in motion, Corbeil was
reinforced and rendered impregnable against any assaults which, with
their feeble artillery, they could make upon it. Repulsed from its walls,
after several days wasted in the vain hope of taking it, the prince moved
down the left bank of the Seine, and, on the twenty-eighth of November,
encamped opposite to Paris in the villages of Gentilly and Arcueil.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
New proffers came from Catharine; there were new delays on the road. At
Port à l'Anglais a conference with Condé had been projected by the queen
mother, resulting merely in one between the constable and his nephew
Coligny&mdash;as fruitless as any that had preceded; for Montmorency would not
hear of tolerating in France another religion besides the Roman Catholic,
and the Admiral would rather die a thousand deaths than abandon the
point.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Under the walls of Paris new conferences took place. The Parisians worked
night and day, strengthening their defences, and making those
preparations which are rarely completed except under the spur of an
extraordinary emergency. Meanwhile, every day brought nearer the arrival
of the Spanish and Gascon auxiliaries whom they were expecting. At a
windmill near the suburb of St. Marceau, the Prince of Condé, Coligny,
Genlis, Grammont, and Esternay met the queen mother, the Prince of La
Roche-sur-Yon, the constable, his son Marshal Montmorency, and Gonnor, at
a later time known as Marshal Cossé. On both sides there were professions
of the most ardent desire for peace, and "Huguenot" and "papist" embraced
each other cordially at parting. But the dangerous intimacy soon bore the
bitter fruit of open treachery. A <i>camisade</i> had been secretly planned by
the Huguenots, and the attack was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> be made on the enemy's works,
when word was brought that one of the chiefs intrusted with the knowledge
of all their plans&mdash;the same Genlis, who had been the principal advocate
of the delays upon the route&mdash;had gone over to the enemy, and the
enterprise was consequently abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The deliberations being set on foot by the one party, at least, only in
order to gain time, it is not surprising that they accomplished nothing.
The court would concede none of the important demands of the prince. It
was resolved to exclude Protestantism not only from Paris, but from
Lyons, from all the seats of parliaments, from frontier towns, and from
cities which had not enjoyed the right of having preaching according to
the Edict of January. The exercises of the reformed worship could not be
tolerated in any place where the court sojourned&mdash;a cunning provision
which would banish from the royal presence all the princes and high
nobility, such as Renée of France, Condé, and the Châtillons, since these
could not consent to live without the ordinances of their faith for
themselves and their families and retainers. The triumvirs would not
agree to the recall of those who had been exiled. They were willing to
have all proceedings against the partisans of Condé suspended; but they
would neither consent that all edicts, ordinances, and sentences framed
against the Huguenots be declared null and void, nor assent to the
restoration of those dignities which had been taken from them. In other
words, as the prince remarked, the Protestant lords were to put a halter
about their own necks for their enemies to tighten whenever the fancy
should take them so to do.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>At last the Parisian defences were completed, and the Spanish and Gascon
troops, to the number of seven thousand men, arrived. Then the mask of
conciliation was promptly laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> aside. Two weeks of precious time had
been lost, the capital was beyond doubt impregnable, and the unpleasant
fact stared the prince in the face that, after leaving a sufficient force
to garrison it, the constable and Guise might still march out with an
army outnumbering his own.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> On the tenth of December the Huguenot
army broke up its encampment, and moved in the direction of Chartres,
hesitating at first whether to lay siege to that city or to press on to
Normandy in order to obtain the needed funds and support of the English.
The decision was made in a few days to adopt the latter course, and Condé
had proceeded as far as the vicinity of Dreux on the river Eure, when he
found himself confronted by the enemy, who, enjoying the advantage of
possessing the cities and bridges on the route, could advance with
greater ease by the principal roads. The triumvirs, so lately declining
battle in front of Paris, were now as eager as they had before been
reluctant to try their fortunes in the open field. No longer having the
King of Navarre behind whose name and authority to take shelter, they
desired to cover their designs by the queen mother's instructions. So,
before bringing on the first regular engagement, in which two armies of
Frenchmen were to undertake each other's destruction, they had sent
Michel de Castelnau, the well-known historian, on the fifteenth of
December, to inquire of Catharine de' Medici whether they should give the
Huguenots battle. But the queen was too timid, or too cunning, to assume
the weighty responsibility which they would have lifted from their own
shoulders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> "Nurse," she jestingly exclaimed, when Castelnau announced
his mission, calling to the king's old Huguenot foster-mother who was
close at hand, "the generals have sent to ask a woman's advice about
fighting; pray, what is your opinion?" And the envoy could get no more
satisfactory answer than that the queen mother referred the whole matter
to themselves, as experienced military men.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The battle of Dreux, December 19, 1562.</div>

<p>On the nineteenth of December, 1562, the armies met. The enemy had that
morning crossed the Eure, and posted himself with sixteen thousand foot
and two thousand horse, and with twenty-two cannon, between two villages
covering his wings, and with the city of Dreux and the village of Tréon
behind him as points of refuge in case of defeat. The constable commanded
the main body of the army. Guise, to rebut the current charge of being
the sole cause of the war, affected to lead only his own company of horse
in the right wing, which was under Marshal Saint André. The prince's army
was decidedly inferior in numbers; for, although he had four thousand
horse,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> his infantry barely amounted to seven thousand or eight
thousand men, and he had only five pieces of artillery. Yet the first
movements of the Huguenots were brilliant and effective. Condé, with a
body of French horse, fell upon the battalion of Swiss pikes. It was a
furious onset, long remembered as one of the most magnificent cavalry
charges of the age.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Nothing could stand before it. The solid phalanx
was pierced through and through, and the German reiters, pouring into the
way opened by the French, rode to and fro, making havoc of the brave but
defenceless mountaineers. They even penetrated to the rear, and plundered
the camp of the enemy, carrying off the plate from Guise's tent.
Meanwhile Coligny was even more successful than the prince. With a part
of the Huguenot right he attacked and scattered the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> surrounding
his uncle, the constable. In the mêlée Montmorency himself, while
fighting with his usual courage, had his jaw fractured by a pistol-shot,
and was taken prisoner. But now the tide turned. The Swiss, never for a
moment dreaming of retreat or surrender, had promptly recovered from
their confusion and closed their ranks. The German infantry, or
lansquenets, were brought up to the attack, but first hesitated, and then
broke before the terrible array of pikes. D'Andelot, ill with fever, had
thus far been forced to remain a mere spectator of the contest. But now,
seeing the soldiers whom he had been at such pains to bring to the scene
of action in ignominious retreat, he threw himself on his horse and
labored with desperation to rally them. His pains were thrown away. The
lansquenets continued their course, and D'Andelot, who scarcely escaped
falling into the enemy's hands, probably concurred in the verdict
pronounced on them by a contemporary historian, that no more cowardly
troops had entered the country in fifty years.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> It was at this moment
that the Duke of Guise, who had with difficulty held his impatient horse
in reserve on the Roman Catholic right, gave the signal to his company to
follow him, and fell upon the French infantry of the Huguenots,
imprudently left unprotected by cavalry at some distance in the rear. The
move was skilfully planned and well executed. The infantry were routed.
Condé, coming to the rescue, was unable to accomplish anything. His horse
was killed under him, and, before he could be provided with another, he
was taken prisoner by Damville, a son of the constable. The German
reiters now proved to be worth little more than the lansquenets.
Returning from the pursuit of the fugitives of the constable's division,
and perceiving the misfortunes of the infantry, they retired to the cover
of a wood, and neither the prayers nor the expostulations of the admiral
could prevail on them to face the enemy again that day.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> But Guise
could not follow up his advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> The battle had lasted five hours.
Almost the whole of the Huguenot cavalry and the remnants of the infantry
had been drawn up by Coligny in good order on the other side of a ravine;
and the darkness would not allow the Duke, even had he been so disposed,
to renew the engagement.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>On either side the loss had been severe. Marshal Saint André,
Montbéron&mdash;one of the constable's sons&mdash;and many other illustrious Roman
Catholics, were killed. Montmorency was a prisoner. The Huguenots, if
they had lost fewer prominent men and less common soldiers, were equally
deprived of their leading general. What was certain was, that the
substantial fruits of victory remained in the hands of the Duke of Guise,
to whom naturally the whole glory of the achievement was ascribed. For,
although Admiral Coligny thought himself sufficiently strong to have
attacked the enemy on the following day,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> if he could have persuaded
his crestfallen German auxiliaries to follow him, he deemed it advisable
to abandon the march into Normandy&mdash;difficult under any circumstances on
account of the lateness of the season&mdash;and to conduct his army back to
Orleans. This, Coligny&mdash;never more skilful than in conducting the most
difficult of all military operations, a retreat in the presence of an
enemy&mdash;successfully accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p><p>The first tidings of the battle of Dreux were brought to Paris by
fugitives from the constable's corps. These announced the capture of the
commanding general, and the entire rout of the Roman Catholic army. The
populace, intense in its devotion to the old form of faith, and
recognizing the fatal character of such a blow,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> was overwhelmed with
discouragement. But Catharine de' Medici displayed little emotion. "Very
well!" she quietly remarked, "<i>then we shall pray to God in
French</i>."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> But the truth was soon known, and the dirge and the
<i>miserere</i> were rapidly replaced by the loud <i>te deum</i> and by jubilant
processions in honor of the signal success of the Roman Catholic
arms.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Riotous conduct of the Parisian mob.</div>

<p>Recovering from their panic, the Parisian populace continued to testify
their unimpeachable orthodoxy by daily murders. It was enough, a
contemporary writer tells us, if a boy, seeing a man in the streets, but
called out, "Voylà ung Huguenot," for straightway the idle vagabonds, the
pedlers, and porters would set upon him with stones. Then came out the
handicraftsmen and idle apprentices with swords, and thrust him through
with a thousand wounds. His dead body, having been robbed of clothes, was
afterward taken possession of by troops of boys, who asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> nothing
better than to "trail" him down to the Seine and throw him in. If the
victim chanced to be a "town-dweller," the Parisians entered his house
and carried off all his goods, and his wife and children were fortunate
if they escaped with their lives. With the best intentions, Marshal
Montmorency could not put a stop to these excesses; he scarcely succeeded
in protecting the households of foreign ambassadors from being involved
in the fate of French Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Yet the same men that were ready
at any time to imbue their hands in the blood of an innocent Huguenot,
were full of commiseration for a Roman Catholic felon. A shrewd murderer
is said to have turned to his own advantage the religious feeling of the
people who had flocked to see him executed. "Ah! my masters," he
exclaimed when already on the fatal ladder, "I must die now for killing a
Huguenot who despised our Lady; but as I have served our Lady always
truly, and put my trust in her, so I trust now she will show some miracle
for me." Thereupon, reports Sir Thomas Smith, the people began to murmur
about his having to die for a Huguenot, ran to the gallows, beat the
hangman, and having cut the fellow's cords, conveyed him away free.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>Of the triumvirs, at whose instigation the war had arisen, one was
dead,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> a second was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy, the
third&mdash;the Duke of Guise&mdash;alone remained. Navarre had died a month
before. On the other hand, the Huguenots had lost their chief. Yet the
war raged without cessation. As soon as the Duke of Guise had collected
his army and had, at Rambouillet, explained to the king and court, who
had come out to meet him, the course of recent events, he followed the
Admiral toward Orleans. Invested by the king with the supreme command
during the captivity of the constable, and leading a victorious army, he
speedily reduced Étampes and Pithiviers, cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>tured by Condé on his march
to Paris. Meantime, Coligny had taken a number of places in the vicinity
of Orleans, and his "black riders" had become the terror of the papists
of Sologne.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Not long after Guise's approach, fearing that his design
was to besiege the city of Orleans, Coligny threw himself into it. His
stay was not long, however. His German cavalry could do nothing in case
of a siege, and would only be a burden to the citizens. Besides, he was
in want of funds to pay them. He resolved, therefore, to strike boldly
for Normandy.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Having persuaded the reiters to dispense with their
heavy baggage-wagons,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> which had proved so great an incumbrance on
the previous march, he started from Orleans on the first of February with
four thousand troopers, leaving his brother D'Andelot as well furnished
as practicable to sustain the inevitable siege. The lightness of his
army's equipment precluded the possibility of pursuit; its strength
secured it an almost undisputed passage.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> In a few days it had passed
Dreux and the scene of the late battle, and at Dives, on the opposite
side of the estuary of the Seine from Havre, had received from the
English the supplies of money which they had long been desirous of
finding means to convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> to the Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The only considerable
forces of the Guise faction in Normandy were on the banks of the river,
too busy watching the English at Havre to be able to spare any troops to
resist Coligny. Turning his attention to the western shores of the
province, he soon succeeded in reducing Pont-l'Evêque, Caen, Bayeux,
Saint Lo, and the prospect was brilliant of his soon being able, in
conjunction with Queen Elizabeth's troops, to bring all Normandy over to
the side of the prince.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Meanwhile, however, there were occurring in
the centre of the kingdom events destined to give an entirely different
turn to the relations of the Huguenots and papists in France. To these we
must now direct our attention.</p>

<p>François de Guise, relieved of the admiral's presence, had begun the
siege of Orleans four days after the departure of the latter for Normandy
(on the fifth of February), and manifested the utmost determination to
destroy the capital city, as it might be regarded, of the confederates.
Indeed, when the court, then sojourning at Blois, in alarm at the reports
sent by Marshal de Brissac from Rouen, respecting Coligny's conquests and
his own impotence to oppose him, ordered Guise to abandon his undertaking
and employ his forces in crushing out the flames that had so unexpectedly
broken forth in Normandy, the duke declined to obey until he should have
received further orders, and gave so cogent reasons for pursuing the
siege, that the king and his council willingly acquiesced in his
plan.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> From his independent attitude, however, it is evident that
Guise was of Pasquier's mind, and believed he had gained as much of a
victory in the capture of the constable, his friend in arms, but
dangerous rival at court, taken by the Huguenots at Dreux, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> by the
capture of the Prince of Condé, his enemy, who had fallen into his hands
in the same engagement.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of the Portereau.</div>

<p>The city of Orleans, on the north bank of the Loire, was protected by
walls originally of no great worth, but considerably strengthened since
the outbreak of the civil war. On the opposite side of the river, a
suburb, known as the <i>Portereau</i>, was fortified by weaker walls, in front
of which two large bastions had recently been erected. The suburb was
connected with Orleans by means of a bridge across the Loire, of which
the end toward the Portereau was defended by two towers of the old
mediæval construction, known as the "tourelles," and that toward the city
by the city wall and a large square tower.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Against the Portereau the
duke directed the first assault, hoping easily to become master of it,
and thence attack the city from its weakest side. His plan proved
successful beyond his expectations. While making a feint of assailing
with his whole army the bastion held by the Gascon infantry, he sent a
party to scale the bastion guarded by the German lansquenets, who, being
taken by surprise, yielded an entrance almost without striking a blow. In
a few minutes the Portereau was in the hands of Guise, and the bridge was
crowded with fugitives tumultuously seeking a refuge in the city. Orleans
itself was nearly involved in the fate of its suburb; for the enemy,
following close upon the heels of the fleeing host, was at the very
threshold of the "tourelles," when D'Andelot, called from his sick-bed by
the tumult, posting himself at the entrance with a few gentlemen in full
armor, by hard blows beat back the troops, already sanguine of complete
success.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> A few days later the "tourelles" themselves were scaled and
taken.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>After so poor a beginning, the small garrison of Orleans had sufficient
reason to fear the issue of the trial to which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> were subjected. But,
so far from abandoning their courage, they applied themselves with equal
assiduity to their religious and to their military duties. "In addition
to the usual sermons and the prayers at the guard-houses, public
extraordinary prayers were made at six o'clock in the morning; at the
close of which the ministers and the entire people, without exception,
betook themselves to work with all their might upon the fortifications,
until four in the evening, when every one again attended prayers."
Everywhere the utmost devotion was manifested, women of all ranks sharing
with their husbands and brothers in the toils of the day, or, if too
feeble for these active exertions, spending their time in tending the
sick and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">"A new and very terrible device."</div>

<p>Not only did the Huguenots, when they found their supply of lead falling
short, make their cannon-balls of bell-metal&mdash;of which the churches and
monasteries were doubtless the source&mdash;and of brass, but they turned this
last material to a use till now, it would appear, unheard of. "I have
learned this day, the fifteenth instant, of the Spaniards," wrote the
English ambassador from the royal court, which was at a safe distance, in
the city of Blois, "that they of Orleans shoot brass which is hollow, and
so devised within that when it falls it opens and breaks into many pieces
with a great fire, and hurts and kills all who are about it. Which is a
new device and very terrible, for it pierces the house first, and breaks
at the last rebound. Every man in Portereau is fain to run away, they
cannot tell whither, when they see where the shot falls."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot reverses.</div>

<p>It could not, however, be denied that there was much reason for
discouragement in the general condition of the Protestant cause
throughout the country. Of the places so brilliantly acquired in the
spring of the preceding year, the greater part had been lost. Normandy
and Languedoc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> were the only bright spots on the map of France. Lyons
still remained in the power of the Huguenots, in the south-east; but,
though repeated assaults of the Duke of Nemours had been repulsed, it was
threatened with a siege, for which it was but indifferently
prepared.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Des Adrets, the fierce chieftain of the lower Rhône, had
recently revealed his real character more clearly by betraying the cause

confinement.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Indeed, everything seemed to point to a speedy and
complete overthrow of an undertaking which had cost so much labor and
suffering,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> when an unexpected event produced an entire revolution in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> attitude of the contending parties and in the purposes of the
leaders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assassination of François de Guise.</div>

<p>This event was the assassination of François de Guise. On the evening of
the eighteenth of February, 1563, in company with a gentleman or two, he
was riding the round of his works, and arranging for a general attack on
the morrow. So confident did he feel of success, that he had that morning
written to the queen mother, it is said, that within twenty-four hours he
would send her news of the capture of Orleans, and that he intended to
destroy the entire population, making no discrimination of age or sex,
that the very memory of the rebellious city might be obliterated.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> At
a lonely spot on the road, a man on horseback, who had been lying in wait
for him, suddenly made his appearance, and, after discharging a pistol at
him from behind, rode rapidly off, before the duke's escort, taken up
with the duty of assisting him, had had time to make any attempt to
apprehend the assassin. Three balls, with which the pistol was loaded,
had lodged in Guise's shoulder, and the wound, from the first considered
dangerous, proved mortal within six days. The murderer had apparently
made good his escape; but a strange fatality seemed to attend him. During
the darkness he became so confused that, after riding all night, he found
himself almost at the very place where the deed of blood had been
committed, and was compelled to rest himself and his jaded horse at a
house, where he was arrested on suspicion by some of Guise's soldiers.
Taken before their superior officers, he boldly avowed his guilt, and
boasted of what he had done. His name he gave as Jean Poltrot, and he
claimed to be lord of Mérey, in Angoumois; but he was better known, from
his dark complexion and his familiarity with the Spanish language, by the
sobriquet of "L'Espagnolet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> He was an excitable, melancholy man, whose
mind, continually brooding over the wrongs his country and faith had
experienced at the hands of Guise, had imbibed the fanatical notion that
it was his special calling of God to rid the world of "the butcher of
Vassy," of the single execrable head that was accountable for the
torrents of blood which had for a year been flowing in every part of
France.</p>

<p>After having been a page of M. d'Aubeterre, father-in-law of the Huguenot
leader Soubise, Mérey, at the beginning of the civil war, had been sent
by the daughter of D'Aubeterre to her husband, then with Condé at
Orleans. Subsequently he had accompanied Soubise on his adventurous ride
with a few followers from Orleans to Lyons, when the latter assumed
command in behalf of the Huguenots. Soubise appears to have valued him
highly as one of those reckless youths that court rather than shun
personal peril, while he shared the common impression that the lad was
little better than a fool. True, for years&mdash;ever since the tumult of
Amboise, where his kinsman, La Renaudie and another relative had been
killed&mdash;Mérey had been constantly boasting to all whom he met that he
would kill the Duke of Guise; but those who heard him "made no more
account of his words than if he had boasted of his intention to obtain
the imperial crown."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>He had given expression to his purpose at Lyons, in the presence of M. de
Soubise, the Huguenot governor, and again to Admiral Coligny before he
started on his expedition to Normandy. But the Huguenot generals
evidently imagined that there was nothing in the speech beyond the
prating of a silly braggart. Soubise, indeed, advised him to attend to
his own duties, and to leave the deliverance of France to Almighty God;
but neither the admiral nor the soldiers, to whom he often repeated the
threat, paid any attention to it. In short, he was regarded as one of
those frivolous characters, of whom there is an abundance in every camp,
who expect to acquire a cheap notoriety by extravagant stories of their
past or prospective achievements, but never succeed in earning more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
with all their pains, than the contempt or incredulity of their
listeners. Still, Poltrot was a man of some value as a scout, and Coligny
had employed him<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> for the purpose of obtaining information respecting
the enemy's movements, and had furnished him at one time with twenty
crowns to defray his expenses, at another with a hundred, to procure
himself a horse. The spy had made his way to the Roman Catholic camp,
and, by pretending to follow the example of others in renouncing his
Huguenot associations, had conciliated the duke's favor to such an extent
that he excited no suspicion before the commission of the treacherous
act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Execution of Poltrot.</div>

<p>But, if Poltrot was a fanatic, he was not of the stuff of which martyrs
are made. When questioned in the presence of the queen and council to
discover his accomplices, his constancy wholly forsook him, and he said
whatever was suggested. In particular he accused the admiral of having
paid him to execute the deed, and Beza of having instigated him by
holding forth the rewards of another world. La Rochefoucauld, Soubise,
and others were criminated to a minor degree. During his confinement in
the prisons of the Parisian parliament, to which he was removed, he
continually contradicted himself. But his weakness did not save him. He
was condemned to be burned with red-hot pincers, to be torn asunder by
four horses, and to be quartered. Before the execution of this frightful
sentence, he was, by order of the court, put to torture. But, instead of
reiterating his former accusations, he retracted almost every point.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
To purchase a few moments' reprieve, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> sought an interview with the
first president of the parliament, Christopher de Thou; and we have it
upon the authority of that magistrate's son, the author of an
imperishable history of his times, that, entering into greater detail,
Poltrot persisted constantly in exculpating Soubise, Coligny, and Beza. A
few minutes later, beside himself with terror and not knowing what he
said in his delirium, he declared the admiral to be innocent; then, at
the very moment of execution, he accused not only him, but his brother,
D'Andelot, of whom he had said little or nothing before.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beza and Coligny are accused, but vindicate themselves.</div>

<p>Coligny heard in Normandy the report of the atrocious charges that had
been wrung from Poltrot. Copies of the assassin's confession were
industriously circulated in the camp, and he thus became acquainted with
the particulars of the accusation. With Beza and La Rochefoucauld, who
were with him at Caen, he published, on the twelfth of March, a long and
dignified defence. The reformer for himself declared, that, although he
had more than once seen persons ill-disposed toward the Duke of Guise
because of the murders perpetrated by him at Vassy, he had never been in
favor of proceeding against him otherwise than by the ordinary methods of
law. For this reason he had gone to Monceaux to solicit justice of
Charles, of his mother, and of the King of Navarre. But the hopes which
the queen mother's gracious answer had excited were dashed to the earth
by Guise's violent resort to arms. Holding the duke to be the chief
author and promoter of the present troubles, he admitted that he had a
countless number of times prayed to God that He would either change his
heart or rid the kingdom of him. But he appealed to the testimony of
Madame de Ferrare (Renée de France, the mother-in-law of Guise), and all
who had ever heard him, when he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> that never had he publicly
mentioned the duke by name. As for Poltrot himself, he had never met him.</p>

<p>The admiral himself was not less frank. Ever since the massacre of Vassy
he had regarded Guise and his party as common enemies of God, of the
king, and of the public tranquillity; but never, upon his life and his
honor, had he approved of such attacks as that of Poltrot. Indeed, he had
steadfastly employed his influence to deter men from executing any plots
against the life of the duke; until, being duly informed that Guise and
Saint André had incited men to undertake to assassinate Condé, D'Andelot,
and himself, he had desisted from expressing his opposition. The
different articles of the confession he proceeded to answer one by one;
and he forwarded his reply to the court with a letter to Catharine de'
Medici, in which he earnestly entreated her that the life of Poltrot
might be spared until the restoration of peace, that he might be
confronted with him, and an investigation be made of the entire matter
before unsuspected judges. "But do not imagine," he added, "that I speak
thus because of any regret for the death of the Duke of Guise, which I
esteem the greatest of blessings to the realm, to the Church of God, to
myself and my family, and, if improved, the means of giving rest to the
kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The admiral's frankness was severely criticised by some of his friends.
He was advised to suppress those expressions that were liable to be
perverted to his injury, but he declared his resolution to abide by the
consequences of a clear statement of the truth. And indeed, while the
worldly wisdom of Coligny's censors has received a species of
justification in the avidity with which his sincere avowals have been
employed as the basis of graver accusations which he repelled, the candor
of his defence has set upon his words the indelible impress of veracity
which following ages can never fail to read aright. That Catharine
recognized his innocence is evident from the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> act by which she
endeavored to make him appear guilty. He had begged that Poltrot might be
spared till after the conclusion of peace, that he might himself have an
opportunity to vindicate his innocence by confronting him in the presence
of impartial judges. It was Catharine's interest, she thought, to confirm
her own power by attaching a stigma to the honor of the Châtillons, and
so depriving them of much of their influence in the state.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
Accordingly, on Thursday, the eighteenth of March, Poltrot was put to
death and his mouth sealed forever to further explanations. <i>The next day
the Edict of Pacification was signed at Amboise.</i><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> After all, it is
evident that Coligny's innocence or guilt, in this particular instance,
must be judged by his entire course and his well-known character. If his
life bears marks of perfidy and duplicity, if the blood of the innocent
can be found upon his skirts, then must the verdict of posterity be
against him. But if the careful examination of his entire public life, as
well as the history of his private relations, reveals a character not
only above reproach, but the purest, most beneficent, and most patriotic
of all that France can boast in political stations in the sixteenth
century, the confused and contradictory allegations of an enthusiast who
had not counted the cost of his daring attempt&mdash;allegations wrung from
him by threats and torture&mdash;will not be allowed to weigh for an instant
against Coligny's simple denial.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Of the Duke of Guise the estimates formed by his contemporaries differed
as widely as their political and religious views. With the Abbé Bruslart
he was "the most virtuous, heroic, and magnanimous prince in Europe, who
for his courage was dreaded by all foreign nations." To the author of the
history of the reformed churches his ambition and presumption seemed to
have obscured all his virtues.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The Roman Catholic preachers regarded
his death as a stupendous calamity, a mystery of Divine providence, which
they could only interpret by supposing that the Almighty, jealous of the
confidence which His people reposed rather in His creature than in
Himself, had removed the Duke of Guise in order to take the cause of His
own divinity, of His spouse the Church, of the king and kingdom, under
His own protection.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The Bishop of Riez wrote and published a highly
colored account of the duke's last words and actions, in the most
approved style of such posthumous records, and introduced edifying
specimens of a theological learning, which, until the moment of his
wounding, Guise had certainly never possessed, making him, of course,
persist to the end in protesting his innocence of the guilt of
Vassy.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The Protestants, while giving him credit for some

he might have run a far different course, were compelled to view his

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Renée de France at Montargis.</div>

<p>A famous incident, illustrating the perils to which the Huguenots of the
central provinces were subjected during the siege, is too characteristic
to be passed over in silence. More than once, in the course of the war,
the town and castle of Montargis, the Duchess of Ferrara's residence, had
been threatened on account of the asylum it afforded to defenceless
Protestants flocking thither from all quarters. When the minds of the
Roman Catholics had become exasperated by nine or ten months of civil
war, they formed a settled determination to break up this "nest of
Huguenots." Accordingly the Baron de la Garde&mdash;Captain Poulain, of
Mérindol memory&mdash;brought an order, in the king's name, from the Duke of
Guise, at that time before the walls of Orleans, commanding Renée to
leave Montargis, which had become important for military purposes, and to
take up her abode at Fontainebleau, St. Germain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> or Vincennes. The
duchess replied that it was idle to say that so weak a place as Montargis
could, without extensive repairs, be of any military importance; and that
to remove to any place in the vicinity of Paris would be to expose
herself to assassination by the fanatical populace. She therefore sent
Poulain back to the king for further instructions. Meantime, Poulain was
followed by Malicorne, a creature of the duke's, at the head of some
partisan troops. This presumptuous officer had the impertinence to demand
the immediate surrender of the castle, and went so far as to threaten to
turn some cannon against it, in case of her refusal. But he little
understood the virile courage of the woman with whom he had to do.
"Malicorne," she answered him, "take care what you undertake. There is
not a man in this kingdom that can command me but the king. If you
attempt what you threaten, I shall place myself first upon the breach,
that I may find out whether you will be audacious enough to kill a king's
daughter. Moreover, I am not so ill-connected, nor so little loved, but
that I have the means of making the punishment of your temerity felt by
you and your offspring, even to the very babes in the cradle." The
upstart captain was not prepared for such a reception, and, after
alleging his commission as the excuse for the insolence of his conduct,
delayed an enterprise which the wound and subsequent death of Guise
entirely broke off.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Montargis continued during this and the next
civil wars to be a safe refuge for thousands of distressed Protestants.</p>

<p>A great obstacle to the conclusion of peace was removed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> Guise's
death. There was no one in the Roman Catholic camp to take his place. The
panegyric pronounced upon the duke by the English ambassador, Sir Thomas
Smith, may perhaps be esteemed somewhat extravagant, but has at least the
merit of coming from one whose sympathies were decidedly adverse to him.
"The papists have lost their greatest stay, hope, and comfort. Many
noblemen and gentlemen did follow the camp and that faction, rather for
the love of him than for any other zeal or affection. He was indeed the
best captain or general in all France, some will say in all Christendom;
for he had all the properties which belong [to], or are to be wished in a
general: a ready wit and well advised, a body to endure pains, a courage
to forsake no dangerous adventures, use and experience to conduct any
army, much courtesy in entertaining of all men, great eloquence to utter
all his mind. And he was very liberal both of money and honor to young
gentlemen, captains, and soldiers; whereby he gat so much love and
admiration amongst the nobility and the soldiers in France, that I think,
now he is gone, many gentlemen will forsake the camp; and they begin to
drop away already. Then he was so earnest and so fully persuaded in his
religion, that he thought nothing evil done that maintained that sect;
and therefore the papists again thought nothing evil bestowed upon him;
all their money and treasure of the Church, part of their lands, even the
honor of the crown of France, they could have found in their hearts to
have given him. And so all their joy, hope, and comfort one little stroke
of a pistolet hath taken away! Such a vanity God can show men's hope to
be, when it pleaseth Him."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Of the four generals on the Roman Catholic side under whose auspices the
war began, three were dead and the fourth was in captivity. The treasury
was exhausted. The interest of old debts was left unpaid; new debts had
been contracted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> Less than half the king's revenues were available on
account of the places which the Huguenots held or threatened. The
alienation of one hundred thousand livres of income from ecclesiastical
property had been recently ordered, greatly to the annoyance of the
clergy. The admiral's progress had of late been so rapid that but two or
three important places of lower Normandy remained in friendly hands.
After the reduction of these he would move down through Maine and Anjou
to Orleans, with a better force than had been marshalled at Dreux;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
the English would gain such a foothold on French soil as it would be
difficult to induce them to relinquish. And where could competent
generals be secured for the prosecution of hostilities? The post of
lieutenant-general, now vacant, had, indeed, been offered to the Duke
Christopher of Würtemberg; but what prospect was there that a Protestant
would consent to conduct a war against Protestants?<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Deliberations for peace.</div>

<p>Catharine was urgent for an immediate conclusion of peace. For the
purpose of fixing its conditions, Condé was brought, under a strong
guard, to the camp of the army before Orleans, and, on the small "Isle
aux Bouviers" in the middle of the Loire, he and the constable, released
on their honor, held a preliminary interview on Sunday, the seventh of
March, 1563.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> At first there seemed little prospect of harmonizing
their discordant pretensions; for, if the question of the removal of the
triumvirs had lost all its practical importance, the old bone of
contention remained in the re-establishment of the Edict of January. On
this point Montmorency was inflexible. He had been the prime instrument
in expelling Prot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>estantism from Paris, and had distinguished himself by
burning the places of worship. It could hardly be expected that he should
rebuild what he had so laboriously torn down. And, whatever had been his
first intentions, Condé proved less tenacious than might have been
anticipated from his previous professions. The fact was, that the younger
Bourbon was not proof against the wiles employed with so much success
against his elder brother. Flattered by Catharine, he was led to suppose
that after all it made little difference whether the full demands of the
Huguenots were expressly granted in the edict of pacification or not. The
queen mother was resolved, so he was assured, to confer upon him the
dignity and office of lieutenant-general, left vacant by Navarre's death.
When this should be his, it would be easy to obtain every practical
concession to which the Huguenots were entitled. So much pleased was the
court with the ardor he displayed, that he was at last permitted to go to
Orleans on his own princely parole, in order to consult his confederates.</p>

<p>The Huguenot ministers whose advice he first asked, seeing his
irresolution, were the more decided in opposing any terms that did not
expressly recognize the Edict of January. Seventy-two united in a letter
(on the ninth of March, 1563), in which they begged him not to permit the
cause to suffer disaster at his hands, and rather to insure an extension,
than submit to an abridgment of the liberty promised by the royal
ordinance.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> From the ministers, however, Condé went to the Huguenot
"noblesse," with whom his arguments of expediency had more weight, and
who, weary of the length and privations of the war, and content with
securing their own privileges, readily accepted the conditions reprobated
by the ministers. The pacification was accordingly agreed upon, on the
twelfth of March, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> officially published in the form of a royal edict,
dated at Amboise, on the nineteenth of March, 1563.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edict of Pacification, March 12, 1563.</div>

<p>Charles the Ninth, by advice of his mother, the Cardinal of Bourbon, the
Princes of Condé and La Roche-sur-Yon, the Dukes of Montmorency, Aumale,
and Montpensier, and other members of his privy council, grants, in this
document, to all barons, châtellains, and gentlemen possessed of the
right to administer "haute justice," permission to celebrate in their own
houses the worship of "the religion which they call reformed" in the
presence of their families and retainers. The possessors of minor fiefs
could enjoy the same privilege, but it extended to their families only.
In every bailiwick or sénéchaussée, the Protestants should, on petition,
receive one city in whose suburbs their religious services might be held,
and in all cities where the Protestant religion was exercised on the
seventh of March of the present year, it should continue in one or two
places <i>inside</i> of the walls, to be designated hereafter by the king. The
Huguenots, while secured in their liberty of conscience, were to restore
all churches and ecclesiastical property which they might have seized,
and were forbidden to worship according to their rites in the city of
Paris or its immediate neighborhood. The remaining articles of the peace
were of a more personal or temporary interest. Foreign troops were to be
speedily dismissed; the Protestant lords to be fully reinstated in their
former honors, offices, and possessions; prisoners to be released;
insults based upon the events of the war to be summarily punished. And
Charles declared that he held his good cousin, the Prince of Condé, and
all the other lords, knights, gentlemen, and burgesses that had served
under him, to be his faithful subjects, believing that what they had done
was for good ends and for his service.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Thomas Smith's remonstrance.</div>

<p>Such was the Edict of Amboise&mdash;a half-way measure, very different from
that which was desired on either side. The English ambassador declared he
could find no one, whether Protestant or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> papist, that liked the
"accord," or thought it would last three weeks. And he added, by way of
warning to Coligny and Condé: "What you, who are the heads and rulers,
do, I cannot tell; but every man thinketh that it is but a traine and a
deceipt to sever the one of you from another, and all of you from this
stronghold [Orleans], and then thei will talke with you after another
sorte."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> He urged the Huguenots to learn a lesson from the fate of
Bourges, Rouen, and other cities which had admitted the "papists," and to
consider that these fine articles came from the queen mother, the
Cardinals of Bourbon, Ferrara, and Guise, and others like them, who
desired to take the Protestants like fish in a net. And he gave D'Andelot
the significant hint&mdash;very significant it was, in view of what afterwards
befell his brother Gaspard&mdash;that the report spread by the enemy
respecting Poltrot's confession was only a preparation that, <i>in case any
of the Huguenot noblemen should be assassinated, it might be said that
the deed had been done in just revenge by the Guises</i>, who would not
hesitate to sacrifice them either by force or by treason.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny's disappointment.</div>

<p>Of the other party, Catharine de' Medici alone was jubilant over the
edict. On the contrary, the Roman Catholic people of Paris regarded it as
an approval of every sort of impiety and wicked action, and the
parliament would register it only after repeated commands (on the
twenty-seventh of March), and then with a formal declaration of its
reluctance.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> But no one was so much disappointed as the admiral.
Hastening from Normandy to Orleans, he reached that city on the
twenty-third of March, only to find that the peace had been fully
concluded several days before. In the council of the confederates, the
next day, he spoke his mind freely. He reminded Condé that, from the very
commencement of hostilities, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> triumvirs had offered the restoration
of the Edict of January with the exclusion of the city of Paris; and that
never had affairs stood on a better footing than now,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> when two of
the three chief authors of the war were dead, and the third was a
prisoner. But the poor had surpassed the rich in devotion; the cities had
given the example to the nobles. In restricting the number of churches to
one in a bailiwick, the prince and his counsellors had ruined more
churches by a single stroke of the pen than all the forces of their
enemies could have overthrown in ten years. Coligny's warm remonstrance
was heard with some regret for the precipitancy with which the
arrangement had been made; but it was too late. The peace was signed.
Besides, Condé was confident that he would soon occupy his brother's
place, when the Huguenots would obtain all their demands.</p>

<p>But while the prince refused to draw back from the articles of peace to
which he had pledged himself, he consented to visit the queen mother in
company with the admiral, and endeavor to remove some of the restrictions
placed upon Protestant worship. And Catharine was too well satisfied with
her success in restoring peace, to refuse the most pressing of the
admiral's requests. However, she took good care that none of her promises
should be in writing, much less be incorporated in the Edict of
Pacification. "The prince and the admyrall," wrote the special envoy
Middlemore to Queen Elizabeth, "have bene twice with the quene mother
since my commynge hyther, where the admirall hath bene very earnest for a
further and larger lybertye in the course of religion, and so hath

<p>On Sunday, the twenty-eighth of March, 1563&mdash;the anniversary of that
Sunday which they had kept with so much solemnity at Meaux, on the eve of
their march to Orleans&mdash;the Huguenot nobles and soldiers celebrated the
Lord's Supper, in the simple but grand forms of the Geneva liturgy,
within the walls of the church of the Holy Rood, long since stripped of
its idolatrous ornaments, and on the morrow began to disperse to the
homes from which for a year they had been separated.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The German
reiters, at the same time, set out on their march toward Champagne,
whence they soon after retired to their own country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of the war.</div>

<p>The war that had just closed undoubtedly constituted a turning-point in
the Huguenot fortunes. The alliance between the persecuted reformers, on
the one hand, and the princes of the blood and the nobility of France, on
the other, had borne fruit, and it was not altogether good fruit. The
patient confessors, after manfully maintaining their faith through an
entire generation against savage attack, and gaining many a convert from
the witnesses of their constancy, had grasped the sword thrust into their
hands by their more warlike allies. In truth, it would be difficult to
condemn them; for it was in self-defence, not against rightful authority,
but against the tyranny of a foreign and hostile faction. Candidly
viewing their circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>stances at the distance of three centuries, we can
scarcely see how they could have acted otherwise than as they did. Yet
there was much that, humanly speaking, was unfortunate in the
conjuncture. War is a horrible remedy at any time. Civil war super-adds a
thousand horrors of its own. And a civil war waged in the name of
religion is the most frightful of all. The holiest of causes is sure to
be embraced from impure motives by a host of unprincipled men, determined
in their choice of party only by the hope of personal gain, the lust of
power, or the thirst for revenge&mdash;a class of auxiliaries too powerful and
important to be altogether rejected in an hour when the issues of life or
death are pending, even if by the closest and calmest scrutiny they could
be thoroughly weeded out&mdash;a process beyond the power of mortal man at any
time, much more in the midst of the tumult and confusion of war. The
Huguenots had made the attempt at Orleans, and had not shrunk from
inflicting the severest punishments, even to death, for the commission of
theft and other heinous crimes. They had endeavored in their camp to
realize the model of an exemplary Christian community. But they had
failed, because there were with them those who, neither in peace nor in
war, could bring themselves to give to so strict a moral code any other
obedience than that which fear exacts. Such was the misery of war. Such
the melancholy alternative to which, more than once, the reformed saw
themselves reduced, of perishing by persecution or of saving themselves
by exposing their faith to reproach through alliance with men of as
little religion or morality as any in the opposite camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It prevents France from becoming Huguenot.</div>

<p>The first civil war prevented France from becoming a Huguenot country.
This was the deliberate conclusion of a Venetian ambassador, who enjoyed
remarkable opportunities for observing the history of his times.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The
practice of the Christian virtue of patience and submission under
suffering and insult had made the reformers an incredible number of
friends. The waging of war, even in self-defence, and the reported acts
of wanton destruction, of cruelty and sacrilege&mdash;it mattered little
whether they were true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> or false, they were equally credited and produced
the same results&mdash;turned the indifference of the masses into positive
aversion. It availed the Huguenots little in the estimate of the people
that the crimes that were almost the rule with their opponents were the
exception with them; that for a dozen such as Montluc, they were cursed
with but one Baron des Adrets; that the barbarities of the former
received the approbation of the Roman Catholic priesthood, while those of
the latter were censured with vehemence by the Protestant ministers.
Partisan spirit refused to hold the scales of justice with equal hand,
and could see no proofs of superior morality or devotion in the adherents
of the reformed faith.</p>

<blockquote><div class="sidenote">Huguenot ballads and songs.</div>

<p>Besides their psalms, hallowed by so many thrilling
associations, the Huguenots possessed a whole cycle of song.
The meagre portion of this that has come down to us is among
the most valuable of the monuments illustrative of their modes
of thought and their religious and political aspirations. At
the same time it brings vividly before us the great crises of
their history. M. Henri Bordier has done a service not easily
estimated at its full worth, by the publication of a
considerable collection of the popular songs of the
Protestants, under the title, "Le Chansonnier Huguenot du
XVI<sup>e</sup> Siècle" (Paris, 1871). These songs are grouped in four
divisions: religious songs, polemic and satirical songs, songs
of war, and songs of martyrdom.</p>

<p>The three oldest Huguenot songs known to exist belong to the
first two divisions, and have been saved from destruction by
the enemies of their authors, in the very attempt to secure
their suppression. They have recently been found upon the
records of the Parliament of Paris, where they obtained a
place, thanks to the zeal of the "lieutenant général" of Meaux
in endeavoring to ferret out the composers of anti-papal
ballads. They were entered, without regard to metre, as so
much prose. A stanza or two of the song entitled <i>Chanson
nouvelle sur le chant: "N'allez plus au bois jouer,"</i> and
evidently adapted to the tune of a popular ballad of the day,
may suffice to indicate the character of the most vigorous of
these compositions. It is addressed to Michel d'Arande, a
friend of Farel, whom Bishop Briçonnet had invited to preach
the Gospel in his diocese of Meaux, and begins:</p>

<p>The "chants religieux," of which M. Bordier's collection
reproduces twenty-five, are partly poetical paraphrases of the
Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, etc., and partly original
compositions on a variety of themes, such as patient endurance
of insult, etc. They display great familiarity with the Holy
Scriptures, and sometimes not a little poetic fire.</p>

<p>The "chants polémiques" treat of a number of subjects,
prominent among which are the monks and nuns, and the
doctrines of the papal church. In one the expiring papacy is
represented as summoning to her bedside cardinals, bishops,
and other members of the clergy, to witness her last
struggles. In another the Sorbonne is held up to ridicule, in
company with all the mediæval doctors of theology. In a third
the poet more seriously combats the belief in purgatory as
unscriptural. But it is the mass that bears the brunt of
attack. The Host figures under the designation, current in the
literature of the sixteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of <i>Le Dieu de
Pâte</i>, or <i>Le Dieu de Farine</i>. The pompous and complicated
ceremonial, with its repetitions devoid of meaning for the
illiterate spectator, is, on the whole, the favorite object of
satire. In strict accordance with the spirit of the rough
controversy of the times, little mercy is shown to religious
antagonists. There is a good specimen of this style of
treatment in an interesting song dating from about 1564,
entitled "Noel nouveau de la description ou forme et manière
de dire la Messe, sur ce chant: Hari, bouriquet." Of the
fifteen stanzas of which it is composed, two or three may
serve as samples. The preliminary service over, the priest
comes to the consecration of the wafer:</p>

The "chants de guerre" furnish a running commentary upon the
military events of the last forty years of the sixteenth
century, which is not devoid of interest or importance. The
hopeful spirit characterizing the earlier ballads is not lost
even in the latest; but the brilliant anticipations of a
speedy triumph of the truth, found before the outbreak of the
first civil war, or immediately thereafter, are lacking in
other productions, dating from the close of the reign of Henry
the Third. In a spirited song, presumably belonging to 1562,
the poet, adopting the nickname of Huguenots given to the
Protestants by their opponents, retaliates by applying an
equally unwelcome term to the Roman Catholics, and forecasting
the speedy overthrow of the papacy:</p>

<p>The current expectation of the Protestants is attested in a
long narrative ballad by Antoine Du Plain on the siege of
Lyons (1563), in which Charles the Ninth figures as another
Josiah destined to abolish the idolatrous mass:</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the words "va chasser l'Idole" are an
anagram of the royal title <i>Charles de Valois</i>&mdash;an anagram
which gave the Huguenots no little comfort. The same play upon
words appears with a slight variation in a "Huictain au Peuple
de Paris, sur l'anagrammatisme du nom du tres-Chrestien Roy de
France, Charles de Valois IX. de ce nom" (Recueil des Choses
Mémorables, 1565, p. 367), of which the last line is,</p>

<p class='center'>"O Gentil Roy qui <i>chassa leur idole</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
But after the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day the hopes of
the Huguenots were blighted. If the king is not referred to by
name, his mother figures as the guilty cause of all the
misfortune of France. She is a second Helen born for the ruin
of her adopted country, according to Étienne de Maisonfleur.</p>

<p>"Léon" is Catharine's uncle, Pope Leo the Tenth, who was said
to have predicted the total destruction of whatever house she
should be married into. See also the famous libel "Discours
merveilleux de la vie de Catherine de Medicis" (Ed. of
Cologne, Pierre du Marteau, 1693), p. 609.</p>

<p>The massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day naturally contributes a
considerable fund of laments, etc., to the Huguenot popular
poetry of the century. A poem apparently belonging to a more
remote date, discovered by Dr. Roullin, and perhaps the only
Breton song of the kind that has come down to us, is as simple
and unaffected a narrative as any of the modern Greek
<i>m&oelig;rologia</i> (Vaurigaud, Essaie sur l'hist. des églises réf.
de Bretagne, 1870, i. 6). It tells the story of a Huguenot
girl betrayed to the executioner by her own mother. In spite
of a few dialectic forms, the verses are easily understood.</p>

to that of the infamous Queen of Israel. A Protestant poem, evidently of
a date posterior to the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, is still extant in
the National Library of Paris, in which the comparison of the two is
drawn out at full length. The one was the ruin of Israel, the other of
France. The one maintained idolatry, the other papacy. The one slew God's
holy prophets, the other has slain a hundred thousand followers of the
Gospel. Both have killed, in order to obtain the goods of their victims.
But the unkindest verses are the last&mdash;even the very dogs will refuse to
touch Catharine's "carrion."</p>

from MSS. of Nicholas Pithou, p. 105. This learned jurist, the equal of
his more celebrated brothers in ability, and their superior in moral
courage, has left his testimony respecting the beneficent influence of
the reformed doctrines upon his fellow-citizens: "A la verité la ville de
Troyes en général fit une perte incroyable en la rupture de cette Église.
Car c'était une grande beauté et chose plus que émerveillable de la voir
si bien fleurie. Il se voyoit en la jeunesse, touchée par la prédication
de la parole de Dieu, qui auparavant était si dépravée que rien plus, un
changement si subit et si étrange que les catholiques mêmes en étoient
tout étonnés. Car, tels qui au précédent se laissaient aller du tout à
leurs voluptez et s'étaient plongez en gourmandises, yvrogneries et jeux
défendus, tellement qu'ils y passaient la plus grande et meilleure partie
du temps, et faisaient un fort mauvais ménage, depuis qu'ils étaient
entrés dans l'Église quittaient du tout leur vie passée et la
détestaient, se rangeant et se soumettant allègrement à la discipline
ecclésiastique, ce qui était si agréable aux parents de tels personnages,
que, quoiqu'ils fussent catholiques, ils en louaient Dieu." Ibid., pp.
107, 108.</p></div>

correspondence which the Duke of Guise had, ever since the previous
summer, maintained with the Duke of Würtemberg. From the letters
published in the Bulletin of the French Protestant Historical Society
(February and March, 1875), we see that François endeavored to alienate
Christopher from the Huguenots by representing the latter as bitter
enemies of the Augsburg Confession, and as speaking of it with
undisguised contempt. (Letter of July 2, 1561, Bull., xxiv. 72.)
Christopher made no reply to these statements, but urged his
correspondent to a candid examination of religious truth, irrespective of
age or prescription, reminding him (letter of Nov. 22, 1561) that our
Lord Jesus Christ "did not say 'I am the <i>ancient custom</i>,' but 'I am the
<i>Truth</i>.'" (Ibid., xxiv. 114.) And he added, sensibly enough, that, had
the pagan ancestors of both the French and the Germans followed the rule
of blind obedience to custom, they would certainly never have become
Christians.</p></div>

essential a part of their nature, that we cease to wonder at any possible
extreme of lying. It was, however, no new thing with the cardinal to
assume immaculate innocence. Over two years before this time, at the
beginning of the reign of Francis II., when bloody persecution was at its
height, Sir Nicholas Throkmorton wrote to Queen Elizabeth, Sept. 10,
1559: "I am enformed that they here begin to persecute againe for
religion more than ever they did; and that at Paris there are three or
four executed for the same, and diverse greate personages threatened
shortly to be called to answer for their religion. Wherin the Cardinal of
Lorraine having bene spoken unto, within these two daies, hathe said,
<i>that it is not his faulte; and that there is no man that more hateth

has a complete list of forty-eight that died within a month, and refers
to others besides. A contemporary engraving is extant depicting in quaint
but lively style the murderous affair. Montfaucon reproduces it. So does
also M. Horace Gourjon in a pamphlet entitled "Le Massacre de Vassy"
(Paris, 1844). He gives, in addition, an exterior view of the barn in
which the Huguenots were worshipping.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Besides a brief Latin memoir of minor importance, there
were published two detailed accounts of the massacre written by
Huguenots. The one is entitled "Destruction du Saccagement, exerce
cruellement par le Duc de Guise et sa cohorte, en la ville de Vassy, le
premier jour de Mars, 1561. À Caens. M.D.LXII.," and having for its
epigraph the second verse of the 79th psalm in Marot's poetical version,
"The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the
fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the
earth." (The year 1562, it will be remembered, did not commence in France
until Easter Sunday, March 29th.) The account seems to have been composed
on the spot and within a very few days of the occurrence. This may be
inferred from the list of those who died being given only up to Tuesday,
March 3d. The other narrative: "Discours entier de la persecution et
cruauté exercée en la ville de Vassy," etc., enters into much greater
detail, and is preceded by a full account of the early history of the
Church. It was written and published a little later in the spring of
1562. Both memoirs are reprinted in the invaluable Archives curieuses of
Messrs. Cimber et Danjou, iv. 103-110, and 123-156, as well as in the
Mémoires de Condé, iii. 111-115, 124-149 (the former document with the
title "Relation de l'occasion"), etc. Another contemporary account was
written in Guise's interest, and contains a long extract of a letter of
his to the Duke of Würtemberg: "Discours au vray et en abbregé de ce qui
est dernièrement aduenu à Vassi, y passant Monseigneur le Duc de Guise. A
Paris. M.D.LXII.... Par priuilege expres dudict Seigneur." (Cimber, iv.
111-122; Mém. de Condé, iii. 115-122). To these authorities must be added
Guise's vindication in parliament (Cimber, iv. 157, etc., from Reg. of
Parl.; Mém. de Guise, 488, etc.), and his letter and that of the Cardinal
of Lorraine to Christopher of Würtemberg, March 22 (Ib. 491, 492).
Compare J. de Serres, De statu rel. et reip. (1571), ii. 13-17; De Thou,
iii. 129, etc.; Jehan de la Fosse, 45. Davila, bk. iii. in init., is more
accurate than Castelnau, iii., c. 7. Claude Haton's account (Mémoires, i.
204-206) may be classed with the curiosities of literature. This
veracious chronicler would have it that a crowd of Huguenots, with stones
in their hands, and singing at the top of their voices, attempted to
prevent the passage of the duke and his company through the outskirts of
Vassy, where they were apparently worshipping in the open air! Of course
they were the aggressors.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> And yet there is great force in M. Sismondi's observation
(Hist. des Français, xviii. 264): "Malgré leur assertion, il est
difficile de ne pas croire qu'au moment où ils se réunissoient en armes
pour disputer aux protestans l'exercise public de leur culte que leur
accordoit l'édit de janvier, c'etoit un coup prémédité que l'attaque du
duc de Guise contre une congrégation de huguenots, composée, à ce qu'il
assure, en partie de ses vassaux, et qui se trouvoit la première sur son
passage à peu de distance de ses terres."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> It is extremely unfortunate that Mr. Froude should have
based his account of French affairs at this important point upon so
inaccurate and prejudiced a writer as Varillas. To be correct in his
delineation of these transactions was almost as important for his object,
as to be correct in the narration of purely English occurrences. If he
desired to avoid the labor, from which he might well wish to be excused,
of mastering the great accumulation of contemporary and original French
authorities, he might have resorted with propriety, as he has done in the
case of the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, to Henri Martin's noble
history, or to the history of Sismondi, not to speak of Soldan, Von
Polenz, and a host of others. Varillas wrote, about a century after the
events he described, a number of works of slender literary, and still
slighter historical value. His "Histoire de Charles IX." (Cologne,
1686)&mdash;the work which Mr. Froude has but too often followed&mdash;begins with
an adulatory dedication to Louis XIV., the first sentence of which
sufficiently reveals the author's prepossessions: "Sire, it is impossible
to write the history of Charles IX. without beginning the panegyric of
your Majesty." No wonder that Mr. Froude's account of the massacre of
Vassy (History of England, vii. 401, 402), derived solely from this
source (Hist. de Charles IX., i. 126, etc.), is as favorable to Guise as
his most devoted partisan could have desired. But where in the
world&mdash;even in Varillas&mdash;did the English historian ever find authority
for the statement (vii. 402) that, in consequence of the necessity felt
by Guise for temporizing, a little later "<i>the affair at Vassy was
censured in a public decree</i>"? To have allowed <i>that</i> would have been for
Guise to admit that he was guilty of murder, and that his enemies had not
slandered him when they styled him a "butcher of the human race." The
duke <i>never did</i> make such an acknowledgment; on the contrary, he
asseverated his innocence in his last breath. What was really done on the
occasion referred to was to try to shift the responsibility of the war
from the shoulders of the papists to those of the Huguenots, by
pretending to re-enact the edict of January with restrictions as to the
capital.</p></div>

evidence that he had not taken up arms without the best warrant, and that
he could not in any way be regarded as a rebel. They contain no allusion
to any promise to lay down his arms so soon as she sent him word&mdash;the

compared with that of Guise only a few weeks earlier. "Only the merchants
and a few counsellors of the city were present," says Jehan de la Fosse
(p. 47). The king rode between the queen mother and the King of Navarre.
According to Chamberlain, it was a <i>sober</i>, but not a <i>solemn</i> entry (C.
to Chaloner, April 7, 1562, State Paper Office). Either when Guise
returned to Paris from Fontainebleau, or on his previous entry into the
city&mdash;it is difficult from Claude Haton's confused narrative to determine
which was intended&mdash;the people sang: "Blessed is he that cometh in the

that city it was known that the triumvirs had set out for Fontainebleau.
Beza, not apparently without good reason, blamed the improvidence of
Condé in not forestalling the enemy. "Hostes, relicto in urbe non magno
præsidio, in aulam abierunt quod difficile non erat et prospicere et

Tavannes, Catharine did not cease to endeavor to favor the Huguenots. He
assures us that, a few months later, during the summer, his father,
Gaspard de Tavannes, intercepted at Châlons a messenger whom Catharine
had despatched to her daughter the Duchess of Savoy ("qui agréoit ces
nouvelles opinions") ostensibly as a lute-player. Among his effects the
prying governor of Burgundy found letters signed by the queen mother,
containing some rather surprising suggestions. "La Royne luy escrivoit
qu'elle estoit resolue de favoriser les Huguenots, d'où elle espéroit son
salut contre le gouvernement du triumvirat ... qu'elle soupçonnoit
vouloir oster la couronne à ses enfans; et prioit madame de Savoye
d'aider lesdits Huguenots de Lyon, Dauphiné et Provence, et qu'elle
persuadast son mary d'empescher les Suisses et levée d'Italie des
Catholiques." Mém. de Tavannes (Petitot ed.), ii. 341, 342. Tavannes did
not dare to detain the messenger, nor to take away his letters; and if,
as his son asserts, the enmity of Catharine, which the discovery of her
secret gained for him, delayed his acquisition of the marshal's baton for
ten years, he certainly had some reason to remember and regret his
ill-timed curiosity.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, the zealous Roman Catholic had his arguments for the
preservation and worship of images, some of which may strike us as
sufficiently whimsical. "I confess," says one, "that God has forbidden
idols and idolatry, but He has not forbidden the images (or pictures)
which we hold for the veneration of the saints. For if that were so, <i>He
would not have left us the effigy of his holy face</i> painted in His
likeness, on the cloth which that good lady Veronica presented Him, which
yet to-day is looked upon with so much devotion in the church of St.
Peter at Rome, nor the impression of His holy body represented in the
'saint suaire' which is at Chambéry. Is it not found that Saint Luke
thrice made with his own hand the portrait of Our Lady?... That holy
evangelist ought certainly to have known the will of his Lord and Master
better than you, my opponent, who wish to interpret the Scripture
according to your sensuality." Discours des Guerres de Provence (Arch.
curieuses, iv. 501, 502). Of course, the author never dreamed that his

an interesting conversation which he held with the Baron des Adrets, then
an old man, a dozen years later, in the city of Lyons. In answer to the
question, Why he had resorted to acts of cruelty unbecoming to his great
valor? the baron replied that no one commits cruelty in avenging cruelty;
for, if the first measures are <i>cruelty</i>, the second are <i>justice</i>. His
severities, he urged, were needed in order to show proper spirit in view
of the past, and proper regard for the future. His soldiers must be
forced to commit themselves beyond hope of pardon&mdash;they must, especially
in a war in which their opponents cloaked themselves with the royal
authority, fight without respect of persons. "The soldier cannot be
taught," said he with characteristic bluntness, "to carry his sword and
his hat in his hand at the same time." When asked what motive he had in
subsequently leaving his old comrades in arms, he explained that it was
neither fear nor avarice, but disgust at their timid policy and at seeing
himself superseded. And to D'Aubigné's third question&mdash;a somewhat bold
one, it must be confessed&mdash;Why success had never attended his recent
undertakings, he answered "with a sigh": "<i>Mon enfant</i>, nothing is too
warm for a captain who has no greater anxiety for victory than have his
soldiers. With the Huguenots I had <i>soldiers</i>; since then I have had only
<i>hucksters</i>, who cared for nothing but money. The former were moved by
apprehension unmingled with fear, and revenge, passion, and honor were
the wages they fought for. I could not give those Huguenot soldiers
<i>reins</i> enough; the others have worn out my <i>spurs</i>."</p></div>

prisoners from the common slaughter to expiate the massacre of Orange by
a similar method. One of them was observed by Des Adrets to draw back
twice before taking the fatal leap. "What!" said the chief, "do you take
<i>two springs</i> to do it?" "I will give you <i>ten</i> to do it!" the witty
soldier replied; and the laugh he evoked from those grim lips saved his

its provisions before the seneschal, viguier, and capitouls, and, when he
preached, these last had been present to prevent disturbance. A place of
worship, twenty-four cannes long by sixteen in width (174 feet by 116),
had been built on the spot assigned by the authorities. Hist. ecclés. des

"thank God for four thousand murders." Yet a century later, in 1862,
Monseigneur Desprez, Archbishop of Toulouse, gave notice of the
recurrence of the celebration in these words: "The Catholic Church always
makes it a duty to recall, in the succession of ages, the most remarkable
events of its history&mdash;particularly those which belong to it in a special
manner. It is thus that we are going to celebrate this year the jubilee
commemorative of a glorious act accomplished among you three hundred
years ago." The archbishop was warm in his admiration of the last
centennial procession, "at which were present all the persons of
distinction&mdash;the religious orders, the officiating minister under his
canopy, the red robes, and the members of parliament pressing behind the
university, the seneschal, the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, and finally a company of
soldiers." But the French government, not agreeing with the prelate in
the propriety of perpetuating the reminiscence, forbade the procession
and all out-door solemnities, and declared "the celebration of a jubilee
of the 16th to the 23d of May next, enjoined by the Archbishop of
Toulouse, to be nothing less than the commemoration of a mournful and
bloody episode of our ancient religious discords." See a letter from a
correspondent of the New York Evening Post, Paris, April 10, 1862.</p></div>

contemptuous disobedience of the <i>people</i> of Paris and their cruelty are
frequent topics touched upon in Throkmorton's correspondence. He
acknowledges himself to be afraid, because of "the daily despites,
injuries, and threatenings put in use towards him and his by the
insolent, raging people." He sees that "neither the authority of the
king, the queen mother, or any other person can be sanctuary" for him;
for they "daily most cruelly kill every person (no age or sex excepted)
whom they take to be contrary to their religion, notwithstanding daily
proclamations under pain of death to the contrary." He declares that the
king and his mother are, "for their own safety, constrained to lie at
Bois de Vincennes, not thinking good to commit themselves into the hands
of the furious Parisians;" and that the Chancellor of France, "being the
most sincere man of this prince's council," is in as great fear of his
life as Throkmorton himself, being lodged hard by the Bois de Vincennes,
where he has the protection of the king's guards; and yet even there he
has been threatened with a visit from the Parisians, and with being
killed in his own house. See both of Throkmorton's despatches to the

of powder, he was compelled reluctantly to destroy, or render useless,
and abandon munitions of war of which he stood in great need; for the
enemy had taken the precaution to kill or drive away the horses, and the
wagons could not be dragged to Orleans, a distance of over twenty miles.
It happened that Sir Nicholas Throkmorton, whose instructive
correspondence furnishes so lucid a commentary upon the events from 1559
to 1563, was travelling under escort of the royal train, to take leave of
Charles IX. at Bourges. In the unexpected assault of the Huguenots he was
stripped of his money and baggage, and even his despatches. Under these
circumstances he thought it necessary to accompany Coligny to Orleans.
Catharine, who knew well Throkmorton's sympathy with the Protestants, and
hated him heartily ("Yt is not th' Ambassador of Englande," he had
himself written only a few days earlier, "which ys so greatlye stomackyd
and hatyd in this countreye, but yt ys the persone of Nicholas
Throkmorton," Forbes, ii. 33), would have it that he had purposely thrown
himself into the hands of the Huguenots. His confidential correspondence
with Queen Elizabeth does not bear out the charge. Despatch from Orleans,
Sept. 9, 1562, Forbes, State Papers, ii. 36, etc. Catharine assured Sir
Thomas Smith, on his arrival at court as English ambassador, that she
wished he had been sent before, instead of Throkmorton, "for they took
him here to be the author of all these troubles," declaring that
Throkmorton was never well but when he was making some broil, and that he
was so "passionate and affectionate" on the Huguenots' side, that he
cared not what trouble he made. Despatch of Smith, Rouen, Nov. 7, 1562,

paid to the prince's agents at Strasbourg or Frankfort so soon as the
news should be received of the transfer of Havre, thirty thousand more
within a month thereafter. The other forty thousand were in lieu of the
defence of Rouen and Dieppe, should it seem impracticable to undertake
it. Havre was to be held until the Prince should have effected the
restitution of Calais and the adjacent territory according to the
treaties of Cateau-Cambrésis, although the time prescribed by those
treaties had not expired, and until the one hundred and forty thousand
crowns should have been repaid without interest. The compact, signed by
Queen Elizabeth at Hampton Court, Sept. 20, 1562, is inserted in Du Mont,

would recall her troops from France so soon as Calais were recovered and
peace with her neighbors were restored, and that, in the attempt to
secure these ends, she expected the countenance rather than the

indeed, that there were ulterior designs even against Havre. "It is
ment," her minister Cecil wrote to one of his intimate correspondents,
"to kepe Newhaven in the Quene's possession untill Callice be eyther
delyvered, or better assurance of it then presently we have." But he soon
adds that, in a certain emergency, "I think the Quene's Majestie nead not

and warned Cecil that "if the same, for lack of aid, should be surprised,
it might give the French suspicion on our part that the queen meaneth but
an appearance of aid, thereby to obtain into her hands such things of
theirs as may be most profitable to her, and in time to come most noyful
to themselves." Forbes, ii. 90. Unfortunately it was not Cecil, but
Elizabeth herself, that restrained the exertions of the troops, and she
was hard to move. And so, for lack of a liberal and hearty policy, Rouen
was suffered to fall, and Dieppe was given up without a blow, and Warwick
and the English found themselves, as it were, besieged in Havre. Whereas,
with those places, they might have commanded the entire triangle between
the Seine and the British Channel. See Throkmorton's indignation, and the

of Condé, in the case of Sapin (November 2, 1562), makes no mention of
the judicial murder of Marlorat, but alleges only his complicity with

in annulling royal edicts by magisterial orders, in constraining the
king's officers to become idolaters, in declaring knights of the Order of
St. Michael and other worthy gentlemen rebels, in ordering the tocsin to
be rung, and inciting to assassination, etc. Hist. ecclés. des égl. réf.,

Jeanne d'Albret, then at Pau in Béarn, "desiring to have her now to
cherish him, and do the part of a wife;" and the messenger told Sir
Thomas Smith, with whom he dined that day in Evreux, "that the king
pretendeth to him, that this punishment [his wounds] came to him
well-deserved, for his unkindness in forsaking the truth." Forbes, State
Papers, ii. 167. The authenticity of the story of Antoine of Navarre's
death-bed repentance is sufficiently attested by the letter written, less
than a year later (August, 1563), by his widow, Jeanne d'Albret, to the
Cardinal of Armagnac: "Où sont ces belles couronnes que vous luy
promettiés, et qu'il a acquises à combattre contre la vraye Religion et
sa conscience; comme la confession dernière qu'il en a faite en sa mort

this fickle prince much too charitable a portrait (iii. 337). It seems to
be saying too much to affirm that "his merit equalled that of the
greatest captains of his age;" and if "he loved justice, and was
possessed of uprightness," it must be confessed that his dealings with
neither party furnish much evidence of the fact. (I retain these remarks,
although I find that the criticism has been anticipated by Soldan, ii.
78). Recalling the earlier relations of the men, it is not a little odd
that, when the news of Navarre's death reached the "holy fathers" of the
council then in session in the city of Trent, the papal legates and the
presidents paid the Cardinal of Lorraine a formal visit to <i>condole</i> with
him on the decease of his dear relative! (Acta Conc. Tridentini, <i>apud</i>

assemblies" which became more and more frequent as the sixteenth century
advanced. Here the Count of Crussol, subsequently Duke d'Uzès, was urged
to accept the office of "head, defender, and conservator" of the reformed
party in Languedoc. To the count a council was given, and he was
requested not to find the suggestion amiss that he should in all
important matters, such as treaties with the enemy, consult with the
general assembly of the Protestants, or at least with the council. By
this good office he would demonstrate the closeness of the bond uniting
him as head to the body of his native land, besides giving greater
assurance to a people too much inclined to receive unfounded impressions

the battle of Dreux. The author of the Histoire ecclés., ii. 140, and De
Thou, iii. 367, criticise both the Roman Catholic and the Protestant
generals. They find the former to blame for not waiting to engage the
Huguenots until they had reached the rougher country they were
approaching, where the superiority of Condé in cavalry would have been of
little avail. They censure the latter for leaving his own infantry
unprotected, and for attacking the enemy's infantry instead of his
cavalry. If this had been routed, the other would have made no further
resistance.</p></div>

Protestant governor, found that only two weeks' provisions remained in
the city, and therefore felt compelled to issue an order to force some
7,000 non-combatants&mdash;women, children, and the poor&mdash;to leave Lyons, that
Viret, the Huguenot pastor, had an opportunity to display the great
ascendancy which his eminent piety and discretion had secured him over
all ranks in society. According to the newly published Memoirs of
Soubise, Viret boldly remonstrated against an act which was equivalent to
a surrender of thousands of defenceless persons to certain butchery, and
declared that the ordinary rules of military necessity did not apply to a
war like this, "in which the poorest has an interest, since we are
fighting for the liberty of our consciences," adding his own assurance
that help would come from some other quarter. Finally the governor
yielded, saying: "Even should it turn out ill and my reputation suffer,
as though I had not done my duty as a captain, yet, at your word, I will
do as you ask, being well assured that God will bless my act." Bulletin,
xxiii. (1874), 497. It will be remembered that Pierre Viret had been the
able coadjutor of Farel in the reformation of Geneva, twenty-eight years
before. The siege of Lyons was made the subject of a lengthy song by
Antoine Du Plain (reprinted in the Chansonnier Huguenot, 220 seq.),
containing not a few historical data of importance.</p></div>

extorted by the fear of death, and exculpates Soubise, Beza, Coligny,
etc., from having instigated him. He says that when put to torture he
will say anything the questioners want him to. Accordingly, when so
tortured, he accuses them, and when released a moment after the horses
have begun to rend him in pieces, he conjures up a plot of the Huguenots
to sack Paris, etc. May it not properly be asked, what such testimony as
this is worth? For or against Coligny, volumes of it would not affect his

Guise is sufficiently certain; and it is well known that there were those
who believed her to have instigated his murder (See Mém. de Tavannes,

almost every great crime or casualty that occurred in France, for the
space of a generation, was ascribed to her evil influence. Still the
Viscount de Tavannes makes too great a draft upon our credulity, when he
pretends that she made a frank admission of guilt to his father. "Depuis,
au voyage de Bayonne, passant par Dijon, elle dit au sieur de Tavannes:
'Ceux de Guise se vouloient faire roys, je les en ay bien gardé devant

Beza, ii. 706, etc.). Varillas, Anquetil, etc., are scarcely worth

matters of chronology. Davila places the wounding of Guise on the 24th of
February, his death three days later, etc.</p></div>

an affecting letter from the aged Renée of Ferrara to Calvin, in which
she complains with deep feeling of the reformed, and especially their
preachers, for the severity with which even after his death they attacked
the memory of her son-in-law, and even spoke of his eternal condemnation
as an ascertained fact. "I know," she said, "that he was a persecutor;
but I do not know, nor, to speak freely, do I believe that he was
reprobated of God; for he gave signs to the contrary before his death.
But they want this not to be mentioned, and they desire to shut the
mouths of those who know it." Cimber et Danjou, v. 399, etc. Calvin's
reply of the 24th of January, 1564, is admirable for its kind, yet firm
tone (Bonnet, Lettres franç. de Calvin, ii. 550, etc., Calvin's Letters,
Am. edit., iv. 352, etc.). He freely condemned the beatification of the
King of Navarre, while the Duke of Guise was consigned to perdition. The
former was an apostate; the latter an open enemy of the truth of the
Gospel from the very beginning. Indeed, to pronounce upon the doom of a
fellow-sinner was both rash and presumptuous, for there is but one Judge
before whose seat we all must give account. Yet, in condemning the
authors of the horrible troubles that had befallen France, and which all
God's children had felt scarcely less poignantly than Renée herself,
sprung though she was from the royal stock, it was impossible not to
condemn the duke "who had kindled the fire." Yea, for himself, although
he had always prayed God to show Guise mercy, the reformer avowed, in
almost the very words of Beza, that he had often desired that God would
lay His hand upon the duke to free His Church of him, unless He would
convert him. "And yet I can protest," he added, "that but for me, before
the war, active and energetic men would have exerted themselves to
destroy him from the face of the earth, whom my sole exhortation
restrained."

well told in Memorials of Renée of France, 215-217. De Thou (liv. xxx.),
iii. 179, has incorrectly placed this occurrence among the events of the
first months of the war. During the second war Brantôme once stopped to
pay his respects to Renée, and saw in the castle over 300 Huguenots that
had fled there for security. In a letter of May 10, 1563, Calvin speaks
of her as "the nursing mother of the poor saints driven out of their
homes and knowing not whither to go," and as having made her castle what
a princess looking only to this world would regard almost an insult to
have it called&mdash;"God's hostelry" or "hospital" (ung hostel-Dieu). God
had, as it were, called upon her by these trials to pay arrears for the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Scarcely had the Edict of Amboise been signed when a demand was made upon
the English queen for the city of Havre, placed in her possession by the
Huguenots, as a pledge for the restoration of Calais in accordance with
the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, and as security for the repayment of the
large sums she had advanced for the maintenance of the war. But Elizabeth
was in no favorable mood for listening to this summons. Instead of being
instructed to evacuate Havre, the Earl of Warwick was reinforced by fresh
supplies of arms and provisions, and received orders to defend to the
last extremity the only spot in France held by the queen. A formal offer
made by Condé to secure a renewal of the stipulation by which Calais was
to be given up in 1567, and to remunerate Elizabeth for her expenditures
in the cause of the French Protestants, was indignantly rejected; and
both sides prepared for open war.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The struggle was short and
decisive. The French were a unit on the question of a permanent
occupation of their soil by foreigners. Within the walls of Havre itself
a plot was formed by the French population to betray the city into the
hands of their countrymen; and Warwick was forced to expel the natives in
order to secure the lives of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> troops.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> But no vigilance of
the besieged could insure the safety of a detached position on the
borders of so powerful a state as France. Elizabeth was too weak, or too
penurious, to afford the recruits that were loudly called for. And now a
new and frightful auxiliary to the French made its appearance. A
contagious disease set in among the English troops, crowded into a narrow
compass and deprived of their usual allowance of fresh meat and wholesome
water. The fearful mortality attending it soon revealed the true
character of the scourge. Few of those that fell sick recovered.
Gathering new strength from day to day, it reigned at length supreme in
the fated city. Soon the daily crowd of victims became too great to
receive prompt sepulture, and the corpses lying unburied in the streets
furnished fresh fuel for the raging pestilence. Seven thousand English
troops were reduced in a short time to three thousand, in a few days more
to fifteen hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The hand of death was upon the throat of
every survivor. At length, too feeble to man their works, despairing of
timely succor, unable to sustain at the same moment the assault of their
opponents and the fearful visitation of the Almighty, the English
consented to surrender; and, on the twenty-eighth of July, a capitulation
was signed, in accordance with which, on the next day, Havre, with all
its fortifications and the ships of war in its harbor, fell once more
into the hands of the French.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">How the peace was received.</div>

<p>The pacification of Amboise, a contemporary chronicler tells us, was
received with greater or less cordiality in different localities of
France, very much according to the number of Protestants they had
contained before the war. "This edict of peace was very grievous to hear
published and to have executed in the case of the Catholics of the
peaceable cities and villages where there were very few Huguenots. But it
was a source of great comfort to the Catholics of the cities which were
oppressed by the Huguenots, as well as of the neighboring villages in
which the Catholic religion had been intermitted, mass and divine worship
not celebrated, and the holy sacraments left unadministered&mdash;as in the
cities of Lyons and Orleans, and their vicinity, and in many other cities
of Poitou and Languedoc, where the Huguenots were masters or superior in
numbers. As the peace was altogether advantageous to the Huguenots, they
labored hard to have it observed and published."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vexatious delays in Normandy.</div>

<p>But to secure publication and observance was not always possible.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Not unfrequently the Huguenots were denied by the illiberality of their
enemies every privilege to which they were entitled by the terms of the
edict. At Troyes, the Roman Catholic party, hearing that peace had been
made, resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> employ the brief interval before the edict should be
published, and the mayor of the city led the populace to the prisons,
where all the Huguenots that could be found were at once murdered.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
The vexatious delays, and the actual persecution still harder to be
borne, which were encountered at Rouen, have been duly recorded by an
anonymous Roman Catholic contemporary, as well as in the registers of the
city hall and of the Norman parliament, and may serve as an indication of
what occurred in many other places. From the chapter of the cathedral and
the judges of the supreme provincial court, down to the degraded rabble,
the entire population was determined to interpose every possible obstacle
in the way of the peaceable execution of the new law. Before any official
communication respecting it reached them, the clergy declared, by solemn
resolution, their intention to reserve the right of prosecuting all who
had plundered their extensive ecclesiastical domain. The municipality
wrote at once to the king, to his mother, and to others at court,
imploring that Rouen and its vicinity might be exempted from all exercise
of the "new religion." Parliament sent deputies to Charles the Ninth to
remonstrate against the broad concessions made in favor of the
Protestants, and, even when compelled to go through the form of a
registration, avoided a publication of the edict, in order to gain time
for another fruitless protest addressed to the royal government.</p>

<p>When it came to the execution of the law, the affair assumed a more
threatening aspect. The Roman Catholics had resolved to resist the return
of the "for-issites," or fugitive Huguenots. At first they excused their
opposition by alleging that there were bandits and criminals of every
kind in the ranks of the exiles. Next they demanded that a preliminary
list of their names and abodes should be furnished, in order that their
arms might be taken away. Finally they required, with equal perverseness,
that, in spite of the express stipulation of the king's rescript, the
"for-issites" should return only as private individuals, and should not
venture to resume their former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> offices and dignities. Meantime the
"for-issites," driven to desperation by the flagrant injustice of which
they were the victims, began to retaliate by laying violent hands upon
all objects of Roman Catholic devotion in the neighboring country, and by
levying contributions upon the farms and villas of their malignant
enemies. The Rouenese revenged themselves in turn by wantonly murdering
the Huguenots whom they found within the city walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protest of the Norman parliament.</div>

<p>The embittered feeling did not diminish at once after the more intrepid
of the Huguenots had, under military compulsion, been readmitted into
Rouen. There were daily complaints of ill-usage. But the insolence of the
dominant party rose to a still higher pitch when there appeared a royal
edict&mdash;whether genuine or forged has not as yet been settled&mdash;by which
the cardinal demands of the Huguenots were granted. The alleged
concessions may not strike us as very extraordinary. They consisted
chiefly in disarming the Roman Catholics equally with the adherents of
the opposite creed, and in erecting a new chamber in parliament to try
impartially cases in dispute between the adherents of the two
communions.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> This was certainly decreeing but a small measure of the
equality in the eye of the law which the Protestants might claim as a
natural and indefeasible right. The citizens of the Norman capital,
however, regarded the enactment as a monstrous outrage upon society.
Charles the Ninth, happened at this time to be passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> through Gaillon,
a place some ten leagues distant from Rouen, on his way to the siege of
Havre; and Damours, the advocate-general, was deputed to bear to him a
protest drawn up by parliament. The tone of the paper was scarcely
respectful to the monarch; it was positively insulting to the members of
the royal council who professed the Protestant faith. It predicted the
possible loss of Normandy, or of his entire kingdom, in case the king
pursued a system of toleration. The Normans, it said, would not submit to
Protestant governors, nor to the return of the exiles in arms, nor to
their resumption of their former dignities. If the "for-issites"
continued their excesses, they would be set upon and killed. The Roman
Catholic burgesses of Rouen even proclaimed a conditional loyalty. Should
the king not see fit to accede to their demands, they declared themselves
ready to place the keys of their city in his hands to dispose of at his
pleasure, at the same time craving permission to go where they pleased
and to take away their property with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rude rebuff.</div>

<p>Truly the spirit of the "Holy League" was already born, though the times
were not yet ripe for the promulgation of such tenets. The
advocate-general was a fluent speaker, and he had been attended many a
weary mile by an enthusiastic escort. Parliamentary counsellors,
municipal officers, clergy, an immense concourse of the lower stratum of
the population&mdash;all were at Gaillon, ready to applaud his well-turned
sentences. But he had chosen an unlucky moment for his oratorical
display. His glowing periods were rudely interrupted by one of the
princely auditors. This was Louis of Condé&mdash;now doubly important to the
court on account of the military undertaking that was on foot&mdash;who
complained of the speaker's insolent words. So powerful a nobleman could
not be despised. And so the voluble Damours, with his oration but half
delivered, instead of meeting a gracious monarch's approval and returning
home amid the plaudits of the multitude, was hastily taken in charge by
the archers of the royal guard and carried off to prison. The rest of the
Rouenese disappeared more rapidly than they had come. The avenues to the
city were filled with fugitives as from a disastrous battle. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> the
grave parliament, which the last winter had been exhibiting its august
powers in butchering Huguenots by the score, beginning with the
arch-heretic Augustin Marlorat, lost for a moment its self-possession,
and took part in the ignominious flight. Shame, however, induced it to
pause before it had gone too far, and, putting on the gravest face it
could summon, it reappeared ere long at Gaillon with becoming magisterial
gravity. Never had there been a more thorough discomfiture.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> A few
days later the Marshal de Bourdillon made his entry into Rouen with a
force of Swiss soldiers sufficient to break down all resistance, the
"for-issites" were brought in, a new election of municipal officers was
held, and comparative quiet was restored in the turbulent city.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Commissioners to enforce the edict.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Alienation of a profligate court.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Profanity a test of Catholicity.</div>

<p>So far as a character so undecided could frame any fixed purpose,
Catharine de' Medici was resolved to cement, if possible, a stable peace.
The Chancellor, Michel de l'Hospital, still retained his influence over
her, and gave to her disjointed plans somewhat of the appearance of a
deliberate policy. That policy certainly seemed to mean peace. And to
prove this, commissioners were despatched to the more distant provinces,
empowered to enforce the execution of the Edict of Amboise.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Yet
never was the court less in sympathy with the Huguenots than at this
moment. If shameless profligacy had not yet reached the height it
subsequently attained under the last Valois that sat upon the throne of
France, it was undoubtedly taking rapid strides in that direction. For
the giddy throng of courtiers, living in an atmosphere that reeked with
corruption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> the stern morality professed by the lips and
exemplified in the lives of Gaspard de Coligny and his noble brothers, as
well as by many another of nearly equal rank, could afford but few
attractions. Many of these triflers had, it is true, exhibited for a time
some leaning toward the reformed faith. But their evanescent affection
was merely a fire kindled in the light straw: the fuel was soon consumed,
and the brilliant flame which had given rise to such sanguine
expectations died out as easily as it sprang up.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> When once the
novelty of the simple worship in the rude barn, or in the retired fields,
with the psalms of Marot and Beza sung to quaint and stirring melodies,
had worn off; when the black gown of the Protestant minister had become
as familiar to the eye as the stole and chasuble of the officiating
priest, and the words of the reformed confession of sins as familiar to
the ear as the pontifical litanies and prayers, the "assemblée" ceased to
attract the curious from the salons of St. Germain and Fontainebleau.
Besides, it was one thing to listen to a scathing account of the abuses
of churchmen, or a violent denunciation of the sins of priest and monk,
and quite another to submit to a faithful recital of the iniquities of
the court, and hear the wrath of God denounced against the profane, the
lewd, and the extortionate. There were some incidents, occurring just at
the close of the war, that completed the alienation which before had been
only partial. The Huguenots had attempted by stringent regulations to
banish swearing, robbery, and other flagrant crimes from their army. They
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> punished robbery in many instances with death. They had succeeded so
far in doing away with oaths, that their opponents had paid unconscious
homage to their freedom from the despicable vice. In those days, when in
the civil struggle it was so difficult to distinguish friends from foes,
there was one proof of unimpeachable orthodoxy that was rarely disputed.
He must be a good Catholic who could curse and swear. The Huguenot
soldier would do neither.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> So nearly, indeed, did the Huguenot
affirmation approach to the simplicity of the biblical precept, that one
Roman Catholic partisan leader of more than ordinary audacity had assumed
for the motto on his standard the blasphemous device: "'Double 's death'
has conquered 'Verily.'"<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> But the strictness with which theft and
profanity were visited in the Huguenot camp produced but a slight
impression, compared with that made by the punishment of death inflicted
by a stern judge at Orleans, just before the proclamation of peace, on a
man and woman found guilty of adultery. Almost the entire court cried out
against the unheard-of severity of the sentence for a crime which had
never before been punished at all. The greater part of these advocates of
facile morals had even the indiscretion to confess that they would never
consent to accept such people as the Huguenots for their masters.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Admiral Coligny accused.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His defence espoused by Condé and the Montmorencies.</div>

<p>Even after the publication of the Edict of Amboise, there was one matter
left unsettled that threatened to rekindle the flames of civil war. It
will be remembered that the murderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> of the Duke of Guise, overcome by
terror in view of his fate had charged Gaspard de Coligny with having
instigated the perpetration of the foul crime; that, as soon as he heard
the accusation, the admiral had not only answered the allegations,
article by article, but had written, earnestly begging that Poltrot's
execution might be deferred until the return of peace should permit him
to be confronted with his accuser. This very reasonable demand, we have
seen, had been rejected, and the miserable assassin had been torn into
pieces by four horses, upon the Place de Grève, on the very day preceding
that which witnessed the signing of the Edict of Amboise. If, however,
the queen mother had hoped to diminish the difficulties of her position
by taking this course, she had greatly miscalculated. In spite of his
protestations, and of a second and more popular defence which he now
made,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> the Guises persisted in believing, or in pretending to
believe, Coligny to be the prime cause of the murder of the head of their
family. His very frankness was perverted into a proof of his complicity.
The admiral's words, as an eminent historian of our own day observes,
bear the seal of sincerity, and we need go for the truth nowhere else
than to his own avowals.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> But they did not satisfy his enemies. The
danger of an open rupture was imminent. Coligny was coming to court from
his castle of Châtillon-sur-Loing, with a strong escort of six hundred
gentlemen; but so inevitable did a bloody collision within the walls of
Paris seem to the queen, that she begged Condé to dissuade him for the
present from carrying out his purpose. Meantime, Condé and the two
Montmorencies&mdash;the constable and his son, the marshal&mdash;espoused Coligny's
cause as their own, by publicly declaring (on the fifteenth of May) his
entire innocence, and announcing that any blow aimed at the Châtillons,
save by legal process, they would regard and avenge as aimed at
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Taking excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> from the unsettled relations of the
kingdom with England and at home, the privy council at the same time
enjoined both parties to abstain from acts of hostility, and adjourned
the judicial investigation until after arms had been laid down.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Petition of the Guises.</div>

<p>At length, on the twenty-sixth of September&mdash;two months after the
reduction of Havre&mdash;the Guises renewed their demand with great solemnity.
Charles was at Meulan (on the Seine, a few miles below Paris), when a
procession of mourners entered his presence. It was the family of Guise,
headed by the late duke's widow, his mother, and his children, coming to
sue for vengeance on the murderer. All were clad in the dress that
betokened the deepest sorrow, and the dramatic effect was complete.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
They brought a petition couched in decided terms, but making no mention
of the name of Coligny, and signed, not only by themselves, but by three
of the Bourbons&mdash;the Cardinal Charles, the Duke of Montpensier, and his
son&mdash;and by the Dukes of Longueville and Nemours.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Under the
circumstances, the king could not avoid granting their request and
ordering inquisition to be made by the peers in parliament
assembled.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> But the friends of the absent admiral saw in the proposed
investigation only an attempt on the part of his enemies to effect
through the forms of law the ruin of the most prominent Huguenot of
France. It was certain, they urged, that he could expect no justice at
the hands of the presidents and counsellors of the Parisian parliament.
Nor did they find it difficult to convince Catharine that to permit a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
public trial would be to reopen old sores and to risk overturning in a
single hour the fabric of peace which for six months she had been
laboring hard to strengthen.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The king was therefore induced to evoke
the consideration of the complaint of the Guises to his own grand
council. Here again new difficulties sprang up. The Duchess of Guise was
as suspicious of the council as Coligny of the parliament, and challenged
the greater number of its members as too partial to act as judges. In
fact, it seemed impossible to secure a jury to settle the matter in
dispute. After months spent to no purpose in wrangling, Charles
determined to remove the question both from the parliament and from the
council, and on the fifth of January, 1564, reserved for himself and his
mother the duty of adjudication. At the same time, on the ground that the
importance of the case demanded the deliberations of a prince of greater
age and of more experience than he as yet possessed, and that its
discussion at present might prove prejudicial to the tranquillity of the
kingdom, he adjourned it for three full years, or until such other time
as he might hereafter find to be convenient.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Embarrassment of Catharine.</div>

<p>The feud between the Châtillons and the Guises was not, however, the only
embarrassment which the government found itself compelled to meet.
Catharine was in equal perplexity with respect to the engagements she had
entered into with the Prince of Condé. It was part of the misfortune of
this improvident princess that each new intrigue was of such a nature as
to require a second intrigue to bolster it up. Yet she was to live long
enough to learn by bitter experience that there is a limit to the extent
to which plausible but lying words will pass current. At last the
spurious coin was to be returned discredited to her own coffers.
Catharine had enticed Condé into concluding a peace much less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> favorable
to the Huguenots than his comrades in arms had expected in view of the
state of the military operations and the pecuniary necessities of the
court, by the promise that he should occupy the same controlling position
in the government as his brother, the King of Navarre, held at the time
of his death. We have seen that he was so completely hoodwinked that he
assured his friends that it was of little consequence how scanty were the
concessions made in the edict. He would soon be able, by his personal
authority, to secure to "the religion" the largest guarantees. If we may
believe Catharine herself, he went so far in his enthusiastic desire for
peace as to threaten to desert the Huguenots, if they declined to embrace
the opportunity of reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The majority of Charles proclaimed.</div>

<p>How to get rid of the troublesome obligation she had assumed, was now the
problem; since to fulfil her promise honestly was, for a person of her
crooked policy and inordinate ambition, not to be thought of for an
instant. The readiest solution was found in abolishing the office of
lieutenant-general. This could be done only by declaring the termination
of the minority of Charles. For this an opportunity presented itself,
when, on the seventeenth of August, 1563,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> the queen and her
children, with a brilliant retinue, were in the city of Rouen, on their
return from the successful campaign against Havre. That day Charles the
Ninth held a "lit de justice" in the palace of the Parliament of
Normandy. Sitting in state, and surrounded by his mother, his younger
brothers, and a host of grandees, he proceeded to address the assembled
counsellors, pronouncing himself of full age, and, in the capacity of a
major king, delivered to them an edict, signed the day before, ordering
the observance of his Edict of Amboise and the complete pacification of
his kingdom by a univer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>sal laying down of arms.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> True, Charles was
but a few days more than thirteen years of age; but his right to assume
the full powers of government was strenuously maintained by Chancellor
L'Hospital, upon whom devolved the task of explaining more fully the
king's motives and purposes. Then Catharine, the author of the pageant,
rising, humbly approached her son's throne, and bowed to the boy in token
that she resigned into his hands the temporary authority she had held for
nearly three years. Charles, advancing to meet her, accepted her homage,
saying, at the same time, in words that were but too significant and
prophetic of the remainder of his reign: "Madame ma mère, you shall
govern and command as much or more than ever."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles and the refractory Parliament of Paris.</div>

<p>The Parliament of Rouen, flattered at being selected for the instrument
in so important an act, published and registered the edict of Charles's
majority, notwithstanding some unpalatable provisions. Not so the
Parliament of Paris. The counsellors of the capital were even more
indignant at the slight put upon their claim to precedence, than at the
proposed disarming of the Roman Catholics&mdash;a measure particularly
distasteful to the riotous population of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The details of their
opposition need not, however, find a record here. In the end the firmness
of the king, or of his advisers, triumphed. At Mantes<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Charles
received a deputation from the recalcitrant judges, with Christopher de
Thou, their first president, at its head. After hearing their
remonstrances, he replied to the delegates that, although young and
possessed of little experience, he was as truly king of France as any of
his predecessors, and that he intended to make himself obeyed as such. To
prove, however, that he had not acted inconsiderately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> in the premises,
he called upon the members of his council who were present to speak; and
each in turn, commencing with Cardinal Bourbon, the first prince of the
blood, declared that the edict of Amboise had been made with his consent
and advice, and that he deemed it both useful and necessary. Whereupon
Charles informed the parliamentary committee that he had not adopted this
course because he was under any obligation to render to them an account
of his actions. "But," said he, "now that I am of age, I wish you to
meddle with nothing beyond giving my subjects good and speedy justice.
The kings, my predecessors, placed you where you are, in order that they
might unburden their consciences, and that their subjects might live in
greater security under their obedience, not in order to constitute you my
tutors, or the protectors of the realm, or the guardians of my city of
Paris. You have allowed yourselves to suppose until now that you are all
this. I shall not leave you under the delusion; but I command you that,
as in my father's and grandfather's time you were accustomed to attend to
justice alone, so you shall henceforth meddle with nothing else." He
professed to be perfectly willing to listen to their representations when
modestly given; but he concluded by threatening them that, if they
persisted in their present insolent course, he would find means to
convince them that they were not his guardians and teachers, but his
servants.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> These stout words were shrewdly suspected to come from
"the shop of the chancellor,"<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> whose popularity they by no means
augmented. But Charles was himself in earnest. A fresh delegation of
counsellors was dismissed from the royal presence with menaces,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and
the parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ment and people of Paris were both finally compelled to
succumb. Parliament registered the edict; the people surrendered their
arms&mdash;the poor receiving the estimated value of the weapons, the
tradesmen and burgesses a ticket to secure their future restoration. As a
matter of course, the nobles do not appear at all in the transaction,
their immemorial claim to be armed even in time of peace being respected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope's bull against princely heretics.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal Châtillon.</div>

<p>Pope Pius the Fourth had been as indignant as Philip the Second himself
at the conclusion of peace with the Huguenots. He avenged himself as soon
as he received the tidings, by publishing, on the seventh of April, 1563,
a bull conferring authority upon the inquisitors general of Christendom
to proceed against heretics and their favorers&mdash;even to bishops,
archbishops, patriarchs and cardinals&mdash;and to cite them before their
tribunal by merely affixing the summons to the doors of the Inquisition
or of the basilica of St. Peter. Should they fail to appear in person,
they might at once be condemned and sentenced. The bull was no idle
threat. Without delay a number of French prelates were indicted for
heresy, and summoned to come to Rome and defend themselves. The list was
headed by Cardinal Odet de Châtillon, Coligny's eldest brother, who had
openly espoused the reformed belief, and St. Romain, Archbishop of Aix.
Caraccioli, who had resigned the bishopric of Troyes and had been
ordained a Protestant pastor, Montluc of Valence, and others of less
note, figured among the suspected.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> As they did not appear, a number
of these prelates were shortly condemned.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Not content with this bold
infraction of the Gallican liberties, the Roman pontiff went a step
farther, and, through the Congregation of the Inquisition, cited Jeanne
d'Albret, Queen of Navarre, to appear at Rome within six months, on pain
of being held attainted of heresy, and having her dominions given in
possession to the first Catholic occupant.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The council protests against the papal bull.</div>

<p>In other words, not only Béarn, the scanty remnant of her titular
monarchy, but all the lands and property to which the Huguenot queen had
fallen heir, were to follow in the direction the kingdom of Navarre had
taken, and go to swell the enormous wealth and dominion of the Spanish
prince,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> who found his interest to lie in the discord and misfortunes
of his neighbors. Surely such an example would not be without
significance to princes and princesses who, like Catharine, were wont
occasionally to court the heretics on account of their power, and whose
loyalty to the papal church could scarcely be supposed, even by the most
charitable, to rest on any firmer foundation than self-interest. Nor was
the lesson thrown away. Catharine and Michel de l'Hospital, and many
another, read its import at a glance. But, instead of breaking down their
opposition, the papal bull only forearmed them. They saw that Queen
Jeanne's cause was their cause&mdash;the cause of any of the Valois who,
whether upon the ground of heresy or upon any other pretext, might become
obnoxious to the See of Rome. The royal council of state, therefore,
promptly took the matter in hand, in connection with the recent trial of
the French prelates, and replied to the papal missive by a spirited
protest, which D'Oisel, the French ambassador at Rome, was commissioned
to present. In his monarch's name he was to declare the procedure against
the Queen of Navarre to be not only derogatory to the respect due to the
royal dignity, which that princess could claim to an equal degree with
the other monarchs of Christendom, but injurious to the rights and honor
of the king and kingdom, and subversive of civil society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> It was unjust,
for it was dictated by the enemies of France, who sought to take
advantage of the youth of the king and his embarrassments arising from
civil wars, to oppress a widow and orphans&mdash;the widow and orphan
children, indeed, of a king for whom the Pope had himself but recently
been endeavoring so zealously to secure the restoration of Navarre. The
malice was apparent from the fact that nothing similar had been
undertaken by the Holy See against any of the monarchs who had revolted
from its obedience within the last forty years. Sovereign power had been
conferred upon the Pope for the salvation of souls, not that he might
despoil kings and dispose of kingdoms according to his caprice&mdash;an
undertaking his predecessors had engaged in hitherto only to their shame
and confusion. Finally, the King of France begged Pius to recall the
sentence against Queen Jeanne, otherwise he would be compelled to employ
the remedies resorted to by his ancestors in similar cases, according to
the laws of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Not content with this direct appeal,
Catharine wrote to her son's ambassador in Germany to interest the
emperor and the King of the Romans in an affair that no less vitally
affected them.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> So vigorous a response seems to have frightened the
papal court, and the bull was either recalled or dropped&mdash;at least no
trace is said to be found in the Constitutions of Pius the Fourth&mdash;and
the proceedings against the bishops were indefinitely suspended.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p><p>But while Catharine felt it necessary, for the maintenance of her own
authority and of the dignity of the French crown, to enter the lists
boldly in behalf of the Queen of Navarre, she was none the less bent upon
confirming that authority by rendering it impossible for the Huguenots
ever again to take the field in opposition to the crown. A war for the
sake of principle was something of which that cynical princess could not
conceive. The Huguenot party was strong, according to her view, only
because of the possession of powerful leaders. The religious convictions
of its adherents went for nothing. Let the Condés, and the Colignies, and
the Porciens, and the La Rochefoucaulds be gained over, and the people,
deprived of a head, would subordinate their theology to their interest,
and unity would be restored under her own rule. It was the same vain
belief that alone rendered possible a few years later such a stupendous
crime and folly as the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Many an obscure
and illiterate martyr, who had lost his life during her husband's reign,
might have given her a far juster estimate of the future than her
Macchiavellian education, with all its fancied shrewdness and insight
into human character and motives, had furnished her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's attempt to seduce Condé from the Huguenots.</div>

<p>To overthrow the political influence of the Huguenots she must seduce
their leaders. Of this Catharine was sure. With whom, then, should she
commence but with the brilliant Condé? The calm and commanding admiral,
indeed, was the true head and heart of the late war&mdash;never more firm and
uncompromising than after defeat&mdash;as reluctant to renounce war without
securing, beyond question, the religious liberty he sought, as he had
been averse to take up the sword at all in the beginning. Of such a man,
however, little hope could be entertained. But Louis of Bourbon was cast
in another mould. Excessively small in stature and deformed in person, he
was a general favorite; for he was amiable, witty, and talkative.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
Moreover, he was fond of pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> to an extent that attracted notice
even in that giddy court, and as open to temptation as any of its
frivolous denizens.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> For such persons Catharine knew how to lay
snares. Never did queen surround herself with more brilliant enticements
for the unwary. Her maids of honor were at once her spies and the
instruments of accomplishing her designs. As she had had a fair Rouhet to
undermine the constancy of Antoine, so she had now an Isabeau de Limueil
to entrap his younger brother. Nor did Catharine's device prove
unsuccessful. Condé became involved in an amorous intrigue that shook the
confidence of his Huguenot friends in his steadfastness and sincerity;
while the silly girl whom the queen had encouraged in a course that led
to ruin, as soon as her shame became notorious, was ignominiously
banished from court&mdash;for no one could surpass Catharine in the
personation of offended modesty.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Yet, notwithstanding a disgraceful
fall which proved to the satisfaction of a world, always sufficiently
sceptical of the depth of religious convictions, that ambition had much
more to do with the prince's conduct than any sense of duty, Condé was
not wholly lost to right feelings. The tears and remonstrances of his
wife&mdash;the true-hearted Éléonore de Roye&mdash;dying of grief at his
inconstancy, are said to have wrought a marked change in his
char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>acter.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> From that time Catharine's power was gone. In vain did
she or the Guises strive to gain him over to the papal party by offering
him, in second marriage, the widow of Marshal Saint André, with an ample
dower that might well dazzle a prince of the blood with but a beggarly
appanage;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> or even by proposing to confer upon him the hand of the
yet blooming Queen of Scots,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> the Prince of Condé remained true to
the cause he had espoused till his blood stained the fatal field of
Jarnac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot progress.</div>

<p>But while the queen mother was plying the great with her seductions,
while the Roman Catholic leaders were artfully instilling into the minds
of the people the idea that the Edict of Amboise was only a temporary
expedient,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> while royal governors, or their lieutenants, like

the tidings that came especially from southern France to encourage the
reformers. In the midst of the confusion and carnage of war the leaven
had yet been working. There were even to be found places where the
progress of Protestantism had rendered the application of the provisions
of the edict nearly, if not quite impossible. The little city of Milhau,
in Rouergue,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> is a striking and very interesting instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Milhau-en-Rouergue.</div>

<p>The edict had expressly directed that all churches should be restored to
the Roman Catholics, and that the Protestants should resort for worship
to other places, either in the suburbs, or&mdash;in the case of cities which
the Huguenots had held on the seventh of March, 1563&mdash;within the walls.
But, soon after the restoration of peace, the consuls and inhabitants of
Milhau presented a petition to Charles the Ninth, in which they make the
startling assertion that the entire population has become Protestant ("de
la religion"); that for two years or thereabouts they have lived in
undisturbed peace, whilst other cities have been the scene of
disturbances; and that, at a recent gathering of the inhabitants, they
unanimously expressed their desire to live in the exercise of the
reformed faith, under the royal permission. By the king's order the
petition was referred for examination to the commissioners for the
execution of the edict in the province of Guyenne. All its statements
were found to be strictly correct. There was not one papist within the
city; not one man, woman, or child expressed a desire for the
re-establishment of the Roman Catholic ceremonial. The monks had
renounced the cowl, the priests their vestments. Of their own free will,
some of the friars had married, some had taken up useful trades. The
prior had voluntarily resigned the greater part of his revenues;
retaining one-third for his own support, he had begged that the remainder
might be devoted to the preaching of God's Word and the maintenance of
the poor. The two churches of the place had for eighteen months been used
for Protestant worship, and there were no other convenient places to be
found. Indeed, had the churches been given up, there would have been no
one to take possession. A careful domiciliary examination by four persons
appointed by the royal judge had incontestably established the point.
Over eight hundred houses were visited, constituting the greater part of
the city. The occupants were summoned to express their preferences, and
the result was contained in the solemn return of the commission: "We have
not found a single person who desired or asked for the mass; but, on the
contrary, all demanded the preaching of the Word of God, and the
administration of His holy sacraments as instituted by Himself in that
Word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> And thus we certify by the oath we have taken to God and to the
king."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The cry for ministers.</div>

<p>From other places the cry of the churches for ministers to be sent from
Geneva was unabated. In one town and its environs, so inadequate was a
single minister to the discharge of his pastoral duties, that the
peasants of the vicinity were compelled to baptize one another's
children, or to leave them unbaptized.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> At Montpellier it is the
consuls that beg that their corps of ministers may be doubled; their two
pastors cannot preach every day and three times upon Sunday, and yet
visit the neighboring villages.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Establishment of the Reformation in Béarn.</div>

<p>Nowhere, however, was the advance of Protestantism so hopeful as in the
principality of Béarn, whither Jeanne d'Albret had retired, and where,
since her husband's death, she had been dividing her cares between the
education of her son, Henry of Navarre, and the establishment of the
Reformation. A less courageous spirit than hers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> might well have
succumbed in view of the difficulties in her way. Of the nobility not
one-tenth, of the magistracy not one-fifth, were favorable to the changes
which she wished to introduce. The clergy were, of course, nearly
unanimous in opposition.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> She was, however, vigorously and wisely
seconded in her efforts by the eminent reformed pastor, Merlin, formerly
almoner of Admiral Coligny, whom Calvin had sent from Geneva at her
request.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> But when, contrary to his advice, the Queen of Navarre had
summoned a meeting of the estates of her small territory, she detected
unexpected symptoms of resistance. She accordingly abstained from
broaching the unwelcome topic of reformation. But the deputies of the
three orders themselves introduced it. Taking occasion from a prohibition
she had issued against carrying the host in procession, they petitioned
her to maintain them in the religion of their ancestors, in accordance
with the promise which the princes of the country were accustomed to
make.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Fortunately a small minority was found to offer a request of
an entirely opposite tenor; and Jeanne d'Albret, with her characteristic
firmness, declared in reply "that she would reform religion in her
country, whoever might oppose." So much discontent did this decision
provoke that there was danger of open sedition.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p><p>These internal obstacles were, however, by no means the only
difficulties. The court of Pau was disturbed by an uninterrupted
succession of rumors of trouble from without. Now it was the French king
that stood ready to seize the scanty remnants of Navarre, or the Spaniard
that was all prepared for an invasion from the south; anon it was Montluc
from the side of Guyenne, or Damville from that of Languedoc, who were
meditating incursions in the interest of the Roman Catholic Church. "In
short," exclaims her indefatigable coadjutor, Raymond Merlin, "it is
wonderful that this princess should be able to persist with constancy in
her holy design!"<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Then came the papal citation, and the necessity to
avoid the alienation of the French court which would certainly result
from suddenly abolishing the papal rites, especially in view of the
circumstance that Catharine de' Medici had several times begged the Queen
of Navarre by letter to refrain from taking that decided step.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A plan to kidnap Jeanne and her children.</div>

<p>It speaks well for the energy and intrepidity of Jeanne d'Albret, as well
as for the wisdom of some of her advisers, that she was able to lay in
these troublous times such broad foundations for the Protestant system of
worship and government as we shall shortly have occasion to see her
laying; for she was surrounded by courtiers who beheld in her bold
espousal of the Reformation the death-blow to their hopes of advancement
at Paris, and were, consequently, resolute in their opposition. An
incident occurring some months later demonstrates that the perils from
her treacherous neighbors were not purely imaginary. This event was
nothing less than the discovery of a plan to kidnap the Queen of Navarre
and her young son and daughter, and to give them over into the hands of
the Spanish Inquisition. Shortly after Antoine's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> death, her enemies in
France&mdash;among whom, despite his subsequent denial, it is probable that
Blaise de Montluc was one&mdash;had devised this plot as a promising means of
promoting their interests. They had despatched a trusty agent to prepare
a few of their most devoted partisans in Guyenne for its execution; he
was then to pass into Spain, to confer with the Duke of Alva. The latter
part of his instructions had not been fulfilled when the assassination of
Guise took place. Nothing daunted by this mishap, the conspirators
ordered their agent to carry out the original scheme. Alva received it
with favor, and sent the Frenchman, with his own approval of the
undertaking, to the Spanish court, where he held at least three midnight
interviews with Philip. No design was ever more dear to that prudent
monarch's heart than one which combined the rare attractions of secrecy
and treachery, particularly if there were a reasonable hope in the end of
a little wholesome blood-letting. Fortunately, however, the messenger had
not been so careful in his conversation but that he disclosed to one of
Isabella's French servants all that was essential in his commission. The
momentous secret soon found its way to the Spanish queen's almoner, and
finally to the queen herself. The blow impending over her cousin's head
terrified Isabella, and melted her compassionate heart. She disclosed to
the ambassador of Charles the Ninth the astounding fact that some of the
Spanish troops then at Barcelona, on their way to the campaign in
Barbary, were to be quietly sent back from the coast to the interior.
Thence, passing through defiles in the Pyrenees, under experienced
guides, they were to fall upon the unsuspecting court of the Queen of
Navarre at Pau. In such a case, to be forewarned was to be forearmed. The
private secretary of the French envoy was despatched to inform Jeanne
d'Albret of her peril, and to notify Catharine de' Medici of the intended
incursion into the French territories. The premature disclosure
occasioned the abandonment of the plan; but it is said that Philip the
Second never forgave his unfortunate wife her part in frustrating its
execution.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Council of Trent closes its sessions.</div>

<p>The month of December, 1563, witnessed the close of that celebrated
convocation, the Council of Trent. This is not the place for the
discussion of its extraordinary history, yet it is worth while to note
the conclusion of an assembly which exerted so weighty an influence in
establishing the dogmas of the papal church. Resumed after its long
suspension, on the eighteenth of January, 1562, the council from whose
deliberations such magnificent results of harmony had been expected,
began its work by rendering the breach between the Roman Catholic and the
Protestant worlds incurable. Fortunately for the Roman See, all the
leading courts in Christendom, although agreed in pronouncing for the
necessity of reform, were at variance with one another in respect to the
particular objects to be aimed at. It was by a skilful use of this
circumstance that the Pope was enabled to extricate himself creditably
from an embarrassing situation, and to secure every essential advantage.
At the reopening of the council, the French and German bishops were not
present, and the great majority of the members being poor Italian
prelates dependent almost for their daily bread upon the good pleasure of
the pontiff, it is not surprising that the first step taken was to
concede to the Pope or his legates the exclusive right to introduce
subjects for discussion, as well as the yet more important claim of
sitting as judge and ratifying the decisions of the assembled Fathers
before they became valid. Notwithstanding this disgraceful surrender of
their independence and authority, the Roman See was by no means sure as
to the results at which the prelates of the Council of Trent would
arrive. France and the empire demanded radical reforms in the Pope and
his court, and some concessions to the Protestants&mdash;the permission of
marriage for the priesthood, the distribution of the wine to the laity in
the eucharistic sacrament, and the use of the vernacular tongue in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
portion, at least, of the public services. The arrival of the Cardinal of
Lorraine and other bishops, in the month of November, 1562, to reinforce
the handful of French prelates in attendance, enhanced the apprehensions
of Pius. For, strange as it may appear to us, even Pius suspected Charles
of favoring innovation&mdash;so far had the arch-hypocrite imposed on friend
as well as foe by his declaration of adhesion to the Augsburg Confession!
The fact was that there was no lack of dissimulation on any side, and
that the prelates who urged reforms were among the most insincere. They
had drawn up certain articles without the slightest expectation, and
certainly without the faintest desire, to have them accepted. Their sole
aim seemed to be to shift the blame for the flagrant disorders of the
Church from their own shoulders to those of the Pope. If their
suggestions had been seriously entertained and acted upon, no men would
have had more difficulty than they in concealing their chagrin.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The
monarchs&mdash;and it was their ambassadors who, with the papal legates,
directed all the most important conclusions&mdash;were at heart equally averse
to the restoration of canonical elections, and to everything which, by
relieving the ecclesiastics of their servile dependence upon the crown,
might cut off that perennial fountain for the payment of their debts and
for defraying the expenses of their military enterprises, which they had
discovered in the contributions wrung from churchmen's purses. Thus, in
the end, by a series of compromises, in which Pope and king each obtained
what he was anxious to secure, and sacrificed little for which he really
cared, the council managed to confirm the greater number of the abuses it
had been expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> remove, and to render indelible the line of
demarcation between Roman Catholic and Protestant, which it was to have
effaced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal Lorraine returns to France,</div>

<p>The Cardinal of Lorraine returning to France, after the conclusion of the
council (the fourth of December, 1563), made it his first object to
secure the ratification of the Tridentine decrees. He had now thrown off
the mask of moderation, which had caused his friends such needless
alarms, and was quite ready to sacrifice (as the nuncio had long since
prophesied he would sacrifice)<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> the interests of France to those of
the Roman See. But the undertaking was beyond his strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and unsuccessfully seeks the approval of the decrees of
Trent.</div>

<p>On Lorraine's arrival at court, then stopping at St. Maur-sur-Marne
(January, 1564), Catharine answered his request that the king should
approve the conclusions of Trent by saying that, if there was anything
good in them, the king would gladly approve of it, even if it were not
decreed by the council. And, at a supper, to which he was invited the
same evening at the quarters of the Cardinal of Bourbon, he had to put up
with a good deal of rough jesting from Condé and his boon companions, who
plied him with pungent questions respecting the Pope and the doings of
the holy Fathers.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrangle between Lorraine and L'Hospital.</div>

<p>A few weeks later Lorraine made a more distinct effort to secure
recognition for the late council's work. Several of the presidents of
parliament, the avocat-général, and the procureur du roi had been
summoned to court&mdash;which, meanwhile, had removed to Melun (February,
1564)&mdash;to give their advice to the privy council respecting this
momentous question. The cardinal's proposition met with little favor.
Chancellor L'Hospital distinguished himself by his determined opposition,
and boldly refuted the churchman's arguments. The cardinal had long been
chafing at the intractability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> of the lawyer, who owed his early
advancement to the influence of the house of Guise, and now could no
longer contain his anger. He spoke in a loud and imperious tone, and used
taunts that greatly provoked the illustrious bystanders. "It is high time
for you to drop your mask," he said to L'Hospital, "for, as for myself, I
cannot discover what religion you are of. In fact, you seem to have no
other religion than to injure as much as possible both me and my house.
Ingrate that you are, you have forgotten all the benefits you have
received at my hands." The chancellor's answer was quiet and dignified.
"I shall always be ready, even at the peril of my life, to return my
obligations to you. I cannot do it at the expense of the king's honor and
welfare." And he added the pointed observation that the cardinal was
desirous of effecting, by intrigue, what he had been unable to effect by
force of arms. Others took up the debate, the old constable himself
disclaiming any intention of disputing respecting doctrines which he
approved, but expressing his surprise that Lorraine should disturb the
tranquillity of the kingdom, and take up the cause of the Roman pontiff
against a king through whose liberality he was in the enjoyment of an
annual revenue of three or four hundred thousand francs. Catharine, as
usual, did her best to allay the irritation; but the cardinal, greatly
disappointed, retired to Rheims.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of Du Moulin.</div>

<p>A few months after the scene at Melun, the most eminent of French
jurists, the celebrated Charles Du Moulin, published an unanswerable
treatise, proving that the Council of Trent had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> none of the
characteristics of a true &oelig;cumenical synod, and that its decrees were
null and void.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> And the Parliament of Paris, although it ordered the
seizure of the book and imprisoned the author for some days, could not be
induced to consent to incorporate in the legislation of the country the
Tridentine decrees, so hostile in spirit to the French legislation.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
Evidently parliament, although too timid to say so, believed, with Du
Moulin, that the acceptance of the decrees in question "would be against
God and against the benefit of Jesus Christ in the Gospel, against the
ancient councils, against the majesty of the king and the rights of his
crown, against his recent edicts and the edicts of preceding kings,
against the liberty and immunity of the Gallican Church, the authority of
the estates and courts of parliament of the kingdom, and the secular
jurisdiction."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>It was shortly before this time that the report gained currency that
Charles the Ninth had received an embassy from Philip of Spain and the
Duke of Savoy, inviting him, it was said, to a conference with all other
"Christian" princes, to be held on the twenty-fifth of March (1564), to
swear submission in common to the decrees of Trent and devise means for
the repression of heresy. But neither Charles nor his mother, still very
much under the influence of the tolerant chancellor, was disposed to
enter upon the path of persecution marked out for them. The conference
was therefore, we are told, gracefully, but firmly declined.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The
story was but an idle rumor, the absurdity of which is clearly seen from
this one fact among many, that Philip had not at this time himself
accepted and published the Tridentine decrees;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> while, from various
docu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>ments that have come down to us, it appears that Catharine de'
Medici had for some months<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> been projecting a trip that should enable
her son to meet several of the neighboring princes, for the purpose of
cultivating more friendly relations with them. From this desire, and from
the wish, by displaying the young monarch to the inhabitants of the
different provinces, to revive the loyalty of his subjects, seriously
weakened during the late civil war, apparently arose the project of that
well-known "progress" of Charles the Ninth through the greater part of
France, a progress which consumed many successive months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "progress" of Charles IX.</div>

<p>Whether the Cardinal of Lorraine had any direct part, as was commonly
reported, in bringing about the journey of the king, is uncertain. He
himself wrote to Granvelle that he had neither advocated nor opposed
it;<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> but the character of the man has been delineated to little
purpose in these pages if the reader is disposed to give any weight to
his assertion. Certain, however, it is that the Huguenots looked upon the
project with great suspicion, and that its execution was accepted as a
virtual triumph of their opponents. Condé and Coligny could see as
clearly as the cardinal the substantial advantages which a formal visit
to the elder branch of the Lorraine family might secure to the branch of
the family domiciled in France; and they could readily imagine that under
cover of this voyage might be concealed the most nefarious designs
against the peace of their co-religionists. It is not surprising that
many Huguenot nobles accepted it as a mark of the loss of favor, and that
few of them accompanied the court in its wanderings.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The English
ambassador, noting this im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>portant fact, made, on his own account, an
unfavorable deduction from what he saw, as to the design of the court.
"They carry the king about this country now," he observed, "mostly to see
the ruins of the churches and religious houses done by the Huguenots in
this last war. They suppress the losses and hurts the Huguenots have
suffered."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> On the other hand, the Roman Catholic party received
their success as a presage of speedy restoration to full power, and
entertained brilliant hopes for the future.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The queen mother was
beginning to make fair promises to the papal adherents, and the influence
of the admiral and his brothers seemed to be at an end.</p>

<p>Leaving the palace of Fontainebleau, the court passed through Sens and
Troyes to the city of Bar-sur-Seine, where Charles acted as sponsor for
his infant nephew, the son of the Duke of Lorraine. The brilliant <i>fêtes</i>
that accompanied the arrival of the king here and elsewhere could not,
however, hide from the world one of the chief results, if not designs, of
the journey. It was a prominent part of the queen mother's plan to seize
the opportunity for carrying out the system of repression toward the
Huguenots which she had already begun. While there is no reason to
suppose that as yet she felt any disposition to lend an ear to the
suggestions of Spanish emissaries, or of Philip him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>self, for a general
massacre, or at least an open war of extermination, she was certainly
very willing by less open means to preclude the Protestants from ever
giving her trouble, or becoming again a formidable power in the state.
The most unfavorable reports, in truth, were in circulation against the
Huguenots. At Lyons they were accused of poisoning the wells, or,
according to another version of the story, the kitchen-pots, in order to
give the impression that the plague was in the city, and so deter the
king from coming.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Catharine had no need, however, of crediting these
calumnious tales in order to be moved to hostile action. Her desire was
unabated to reign under her son's name, untrammelled by the restraint of
the jealous love of liberty cherished by the Huguenots. Their numbers
were large&mdash;though not so large as they were then supposed to be. Even so
intelligent a historian as Garnier regards them as constituting nearly
one-third of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> M. Lacretelle is undoubtedly much more
correct in estimating them at fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand souls,
or barely one-tenth of the entire population of France&mdash;a country at that
time much more sparsely inhabited, and of which a much larger part of the
surface was in inferior cultivation, or altogether neglected, than at
present.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> But, however small their number in proportion to the
papists, the Huguenots, from their superior industry and intelligence,
from the circumstance that their strength lay in the sturdy middle class
and in the nobility, including little of the rabble of the cities and
none of that of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> were a party that naturally awakened the
jealousy of the queen. We need make little account of any exasperation in
consequence of such silly devices as the threatening letter said to have
been put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Catharine's bed-room, warning her that if she did not drive
the papists from about her, "she and her L'Aubespine" (secretary of
state) would feel the dagger.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> She was too shrewd not to know that a
Roman Catholic was more likely to have penned it than a Huguenot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's new zeal.</div>

<p>In furtherance of the policy to which she had now committed herself, she
caused the fortifications of the cities that had been strongholds of the
Protestants during the late war to be levelled, and in their place
erected citadels whereby the Huguenots might be kept in subjection.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
As Easter approached, Catharine revealed the altered tone of her mind by
notifying her maids of honor that she would suffer none to remain about
her but those who were good Catholics and submitted to the ordinary test
of orthodoxy. There is said to have been but a single girl who declined
to go to mass, and preferred to return to her home.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Well would it
have been if the queen had been as attentive to the morals<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> as to the
orthodoxy of these pleasure-seeking attendants. But, to belong to the
"religion ancienne et catholique" was a mantle large enough to cover a
multitude of sins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interpretative declarations infringing upon the Edict.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Declaration of Roussillon.</div>

<p>More direct infringements upon the liberty guaranteed by the Edict of
Amboise had already been made or were yet in store. The legislation which
could not conveniently be repealed by formal enactment could be rendered
null by interpretative declarations. Charles was made to proclaim that by
the Edict he had not intended to permit preaching in places previously
belonging to the patrimony of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> or held as benefices. This was
aimed at such prelates of doubtful catholicity as Saint Romain,
Archbishop of Aix, or the Cardinal Bishop of Beauvais, Odet de Châtillon.
He was made to say, that by the places where Protestant worship could be
held within the walls, by virtue of its having been exercised on the
seventh of March, 1563, were meant only those that had been garrisoned by
Protestants, and had undergone a successful siege. This stroke of the pen
cut off several cities in which Protestantism had been maintained without
conflict of arms. The Huguenot counsellors of the parliament were
deprived of the enjoyment of their right to attend the "assemblée," or
"Protestant congregation," by a gloss which forbade the inhabitants of
Paris from attending the reformed worship in the neighboring districts.
When the court reached Lyons, a city which, as we have seen, had been
among the foremost in devotion to the Protestant cause, a fresh edict, of
the twenty-fourth of June, prohibited the reformed rites from being
celebrated in any city in which the king might be sojourning. Five or six
weeks later, at the little town of Roussillon, a few miles south of
Vienne, on the Rhône, another and more flagrant violation of the letter
and spirit of the edict of pacification was incorporated in a declaration
purporting to remove fresh uncertainties as to the meaning of its
provisions. It forbade the noblemen who might possess the right to
maintain Protestant services in their castles, to permit any persons but
their own families and their vassals to be present. It prohibited the
convocation of synods and the collection of money, and enjoined upon
ministers of the gospel not to leave their places of residence, nor to
open schools for the instruction of the young. But the most vexatious and
unjust article of all was that which constrained all priests, monks, and
nuns, who during or since the troubles had forsaken their vows and had
married, either to resume their monastic profession and dismiss their
consorts, or to leave the kingdom. As a penalty for the violation of this
command, the men were to be sentenced to the galleys for life, the women
to close confinement in prison. I omit in this list of grievances
suffered by the Huguenots some minor annoyances such as that which
compelled the artisan to desist from working in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> shop with open doors
on the festivals of the Roman Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Assaults upon unoffending Huguenots.</div>

<p>These legal infractions were not all. Everywhere the Huguenots had to
complain of acts of violence, committed by their papist neighbors, at the
instigation of priests and bishops, and not infrequently of the royal
governors. Little more than a year had passed since peace was restored,
and already the victims of religious assassination rivalled in number the
martyrs of the days of open persecution. At Crevant the Protestants were
attacked on their way to their "temple;" at Tours they were attacked
while engaged in worship. At Mans the fanatical bishop was the chief
instigator of a work of mingled murder and rapine. At Vendôme it was the
royal governor himself, Gilbert de Curée, who fell a victim to the hatred
of the Roman Catholic noblesse, and was treacherously killed while
hunting.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> If anything more was needed to render the violence
insupportable, it was found in the fact that any attempt to obtain
judicial investigation and redress resulted not in the condemnation of
the guilty, but in the personal peril of the complainant.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé appeals for redress.</div>

<p>Smarting under the repeated acts of violence to which at every moment
they were liable, and under the successive infringements upon the Edict
of Amboise, the Huguenots urged the Prince of Condé to represent their
grievances to the monarch, in the excellence of whose heart they had not
yet lost confidence. The Protestant leader did not repel the trust. His
appeal to Charles and to the queen mother was urgent. He showed that,
even where the letter of the edict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> was observed, its spirit was
flagrantly violated. The edict provided for a place for preaching in each
prefecture, to be selected by the king. In some cases no place had yet
been designated. In others, the most inconvenient places had been
assigned. Sometimes the Huguenots of a district would be compelled to go
<i>twenty or twenty-five leagues</i> in order to attend divine worship. The
declaration affecting the monks and nuns who had forsaken their habit was
a violation of the general liberty promised. So also was the prohibition
of synods, which, though not expressly mentioned, were implied in the
toleration of the religion to which they were indispensably necessary.
But it was the prejudice and ill-will, of which the Huguenots were the
habitual victims at the hands of royal governors and other officers,
which moved them most deeply. The evident desire was to find some ground
of accusation against them. The ears of the judges were stopped against
their appeals for justice. It was enough that they were accused. Decrees
of confiscation, of the razing of their houses, of death, were promptly
given before any examination was made into the truth of their
culpability. On a mere rumor of a commotion in the Protestant city of
Montauban, an order was issued to demolish its walls. The case was far
otherwise with turbulent Roman Catholic towns. The people were encouraged
to acts of violence toward the Huguenots by the impunity of the
perpetrators of similar crimes, and by the evident partiality of those
who were set to administer justice. Out of six or seven score murders of
Protestants since the peace, not two of the abominable acts had been
punished. Under such circumstances it would not be surprising if the
victims of inordinate cruelty should at length be driven in desperation
to take their defence into their own hands.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conciliatory reply of the king.</div>

<p>The king, or his ministers, fearful of a commotion during his absence
from Paris, answered the letter of the prince with tolerable courtesy,
and even made a pretence of desiring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> secure justice to his Protestant
subjects; but the attempt really effected very little. Thus, for
instance, while sojourning in the city of Valence (on the fifth of
September, 1564), Charles received a petition of the Huguenots of
Bordeaux, setting forth some of the grievances under which they were
groaning, and gave a favorable answer. He permitted them, by this patent,
to sing their psalms in their own houses. He declared them free from any
obligation to furnish the "pain bénit," and to contribute to the support
of Roman Catholic fraternities. The Protestants were not to be molested
for possessing or selling copies of the Bible. They must not be compelled
to deck out their houses in honor of religious processions, nor to swear
on St. Anthony's arm. They might work at their trades with closed doors,
except on Sundays and solemn feasts. Magistrates were forbidden to take
away the children of Huguenots, in order to have them baptized according
to Romish rites. Protestants could be elected to municipal offices
equally with the adherents of the other faith.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> In a similar tone of
conciliation the king published an order from Roussillon, remitting the
fines that had been imposed upon the Huguenots of Nantes for neglecting
to hang tapestry before their houses on Corpus Christi Day, and
permitting them henceforth to abstain from an act so offensive to their
religious convictions.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestants excluded from judicial posts.</div>

<p>Such local concessions were, however, only the decoys by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> which the queen
mother intended to lure the Huguenots on to a fatal security. A few
months later, at Avignon, Catharine caused an ordinance to be published
in the king's name, which Cardinal Santa Croce characterized as an
excellent one. It excluded Protestants from holding judicial seats.
Catharine told the nuncio that her counsellors had been desirous of
extending the same prohibition to all other charges under government, but
that she had deterred them. It would have driven the Huguenots to
desperation, and might have occasioned disturbances. "We shall labor,
however," she said, "to exclude them little by little from all their
offices." At the same time she expressed her joy that everything was
succeeding so well, and privately assured the nuncio "that people were
much deceived in her."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>And yet such are the paradoxes of history, especially in this age of
surprises, that, at the very moment the king was depriving his own
Protestant subjects of their rights, he was negotiating in behalf of the
Protestant subjects of his neighbors! The king would not leave
Avignon&mdash;so wrote the English envoy&mdash;without reconciling the inhabitants
of the Comtât Venaissin and the principality of Orange, whom diversity of
religion had brought into collision. And, by the articles of pacification
which the ambassador enclosed, the king was seen "to have had a care for
others also, having provided a certain liberty of religion even to the
Pope's own subjects, which he had much difficulty in obtaining."<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Marshal Montmorency checks the Parisian mob.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His encounter with Cardinal Lorraine.</div>

<p>While the queen mother, under cover of her son's authority, followed the
new policy of opposition to the Huguenots upon which she had now entered,
an incident occurred at Paris show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>ing that even the Roman Catholics were
not unanimous in their support of the Guises and their plan of
exterminating heresy. The governor of the metropolis was Marshal
Montmorency, the most worthy of all the constable's sons. He had
vigorously exerted himself ever since the king's departure to protect the
Huguenots in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. A Protestant
woman, who during the war had been hung in effigy for "huguenoterie," but
had returned from her flight since the conclusion of peace, died and was
secretly buried by friends, one Sunday night, in the "Cimetière des
Innocents." The next morning a rabble, such as only Paris could afford,
collected with the intention of disinterring the heretic. And they would
have accomplished their design, had not Marshal Montmorency ridden in,
sword in hand, and resolved to hang the culprits that very day. "He would
assist the Huguenots," he is reported to have been in the habit of
saying, "because they were the weaker party."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> On Monday, the eighth
of January, 1565, the Cardinal of Lorraine approached the city in full
ecclesiastical dress, with the intention of entering it.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> He was
attended by his young nephew, the Duke of Guise, and by an escort of
armed men, whom Catharine had permitted him to retain in spite of the
general prohibition, because of the fears he undoubtedly felt for his
personal safety. As he neared Paris he was met by a messenger sent by the
governor, commanding him to bid his company lay down their arms, or to
exhibit his pretended authority. The cardinal, accustomed to domineer
over even such old noble families as the Montmorencies, would do neither,
and attempted to ride defiantly into the city. But the marshal was no
respecter of persons. With the troops at his command he met and dispersed
the cardinal's escort. Lorraine fled as for his life into a shop on the
Rue Saint Denis. Thence he was secretly con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>veyed to his own palace, and
shortly after he left the city in utter discomfiture, but breathing dire
threats against the marshal.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The latter, calling into Paris his
cousin the admiral, had no difficulty in maintaining order. Great was the
consternation of the populace, it is true, for the absurd report was
circulated that Coligny was come to plunder the city, and to seize the
Parliament House, the Cathedral, and the Bastile;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and even the first
president, De Thou, begged him, when he came to the parliament, to
explain the reasons of his obeying his cousin's summons, and to imitate
the prudence of Pompey the Great when he entered the city of Rome, where
Cæsar's presence rendered a sedition imminent. The admiral, in reply,
gracefully acknowledged the honor which parliament had done him in
likening him to Pompey, whom he would gladly imitate, he said, because
Pompey was a patriot. Still he saw no appositeness in the comparison, "as
there was no Cæsar in Paris."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The conference at Bayonne, June, 1565.</div>

<p>Early in the month of June, 1565, Charles the Ninth and his court reached
the neighborhood of the city of Bayonne, where, on the very confines of
France and Spain, a meeting had been arranged between Catharine and her
daughter Isabella, wife of Philip the Second. Catharine's first proposal
had been that her royal son-in-law should himself be present. She had
urged that great good to Christendom might flow from their deliberations.
Philip the Prudent, however, and his confidential adviser, the Duke of
Alva, were sus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>picious of the design. Alva was convinced that Catharine
had only her own private ends in view.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Granvelle observed that
little fruit came of these interviews of princes but discord and
confusion, and judged that, had not the queen mother strenuously insisted
upon improving perhaps the only opportunity which she and her daughter
might enjoy of seeing each other, even the interview between the two
queens would have been declined.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> As it was, however, Philip excused
himself on the plea of engrossing occupations.</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances under which the Bayonne conference took
place&mdash;a meeting which Cardinal Granvelle assured his correspondents was
a simple visit of a daughter to her mother,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> but to which
contemporaries, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, ascribed a far deeper
significance. At this meeting, according to Jean de Serres, writing only
four or five years after the event,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> a holy league, as it was called,
was formed, by the intervention of Isabella, for the purpose of
re-establishing the authority of the ancient religion and of extirpating
the new. France and Spain mutually promised to render each other
assistance in the good work; and both pledged themselves to the support
of the Holy See by all the means in their power. Philip himself was not
present, either, it was conjectured, in order that the league might the
better be kept secret, or to avoid the appearance of lowering his dignity
before that of the French monarch.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The current belief&mdash;until
recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> almost the universal belief of historians&mdash;goes farther, and
alleges that in this mysterious conference Catharine and Alva, who
accompanied his master's wife, concocted the plan of that famous massacre
whose execution was delayed by various circumstances for seven years.
Alva was the tempter, and the words with which he recommended his
favorite method of dealing with heresy, by destroying its chief
upholders, were embodied in the ignoble sentence, "Better a salmon's head
than ten thousand frogs."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>In fact, a general impression that the conference had led to the
formation of a distinct plan for the universal destruction of
Protestantism gained ground almost immediately. Within about a month
after the queen mother and her daughter had ended their interview, the
English ambassador wrote to Leicester and Cecil that "they of the
religion think that there has been at this meeting at Bayonne some
complot betwixt the Pope, the King of Spain, and the Scottish queen, by
their ambassadors, and some say also the Papists of England."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">No plan of massacre agreed upon.</div>

<p>Fortunately, however, we are not left to frame by uncertain conjecture a
doubtful story of the transactions of this famous interview. The
correspondence of the Duke of Alva himself with Philip the Second has
been preserved among the manuscripts of Simancas, to dispel many
inveterate misapprehensions. These letters not only prove that no plan
for a massacre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> the Huguenots was agreed upon by the two parties, but
that Alva did not even distinctly declare himself in favor of such a
plan. They furnish, however, an instructive view, such as can but rarely
be so well obtained, of the net of treacherous intrigue which the fingers
of Philip and his agents were for many years busy day and night in
cautiously spreading around the throne of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 14th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">June 15th.</div>

<p>On Thursday, the fourteenth of June, the young Spanish queen, with her
brilliant train of attendant grandees, crossed the narrow stream forming
the dividing line between the two kingdoms, and was conducted by her
mother, her brothers and sister, and a crowd of gallant French nobles, to
the neighboring town of Saint Jean de Luz. On Friday, Catharine and
Charles rode forward to make their solemn entry into Bayonne, where they
were to await their guests' arrival. Before they started, Alva had
already been at work complimenting such good Catholics as the constable,
Cardinal Bourbon, and Prince La Roche-sur-Yon, flattering Cardinal Guise
(his brother of Lorraine was absent from court, not yet being fully
reinstated in favor), the Duke of Montpensier, and vain old Blaise de
Montluc. Nor were his blandishments thrown away. Poor weak Guise&mdash;the
"cardinal des bouteilles" he was called, from the greater acquaintance he
had with the wine and good living than with religious or political
affairs<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>&mdash;was overcome with emotion and gratitude, and begged Alva to
implore the Catholic king, by the love of God, to look in pity upon an
unhappy kingdom, where religion was fast going to ruin. Montpensier threw
himself into Alva's arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> and told him that Philip alone was the hope of
all the good in France, declaring for himself that he was willing to be
torn in pieces in his behalf, and maintaining the meanwhile, that, should
that pleasant operation be performed, "Philip" would be found written on
his heart. To Blaise de Montluc's self-conceit Alva laid siege in no very
covert manner, assuring him that his master had not given his consent to
Catharine's plan for an interview until he had perused a paper written by
the grim old warrior's hand, in which he had expressed the opinion that
the conference would be productive of wholesome results. The implied
praise was all that was needed to induce Montluc to explain himself more
fully. He was opposed to the exercise of any false humanity. He ascribed
the little success that had attended the Roman Catholic arms in the last
struggle to the half-way measures adopted and the attempt to exercise the
courtesies of peace in time of war. The combatants on either side
addressed their enemies as "my brother" and "my cousin." As for himself,
he had made it a rule to spare no man's life, but to wage a war of
extermination. To this unburdening of his mind Alva replied by giving
Montluc to understand that, as a good Roman Catholic, it should be his
task to discover the means of inducing Charles and his mother to perform
their duty, and, if he failed in this, to disclose to Philip the course
which he must pursue, "since it was impossible to suffer matters to go
on, as they were going, to their ruin."</p>

<p>What the duty of the French king was, in Philip's and Alva's view, is
evidenced by the advice of the "good" Papists which the minister reports
to his master with every mark of approbation. It was, in the first place,
to banish from the kingdom every Protestant minister, and prohibit
utterly any exercise of the reformed religion. The provincial governors,
whose orthodoxy in almost every case could be relied upon, were to be the
instruments in the execution of this work.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But, besides this, it
would be necessary to seize a few of the leaders and cut off their heads.
Five or six, it was suggested, would be all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> victims required.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
It was, in fact, essentially the plan of operations with which Alva
undertook a year or two later the reduction of the Netherlands to
submission to Spanish tyranny and the Papal Church. Treacherous
imprisonments of the most suspected, which could scarcely have been
confined within such narrow numerical limits as Alva laid down, together
with a "blood council" to complete the work, or with a massacre in which
the proprieties of judicial investigation would be less nicely
observed&mdash;such was the scheme after Philip's own heart.</p>

<p>But this scheme suited the present frame of mind neither of Charles nor
of Catharine. When the crafty Spaniard, cautiously feeling his way,
begged the young king to be very careful of his life, "for God, he was
convinced, was reserving him to execute a great work by his hands, in the
punishment of the offences which were committed in that kingdom,"<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Charles briskly responded: "Oh! to take up arms does not suit me. I have
no disposition to consummate the destruction of my kingdom begun in the
past wars."<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The duke clearly saw that the king was but repeating a
lesson that had been taught him by others, and contemptuously dismissed
the topic.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine and Alva.</div>

<p>Catharine was not less determined than her son to avoid a resort to arms.
It was with difficulty that Alva could get her to broach the subject of
religion at all. Isabella having, at his suggestion, pressed her mother
to disclose the secret communication to make which she had sought this
interview, Catharine referred, with some bitterness, to the distrust of
Charles and of herself evidently entertained by Philip, which would be
likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> to lead in the end to a renewal of war between France and Spain.
And she reproached Isabella with having so soon allowed herself to become
"Hispaniolized"<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>&mdash;a charge from which her daughter endeavored to
clear herself as best she could. When at last Alva succeeded in bringing
up the subject, which was, ostensibly at least, so near what Philip
called his heart, Catharine's display of tact was such as to elicit the
profound admiration of even so consummate a master in the art of
dissimulation as the duke himself. Her circumspection, he declared, he
had never seen equalled.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> She maintained that there was no need of
alarm at the condition of religion in France, for everything was going on
better than when the Edict of Pacification was published. "It is your
satisfaction at being freed from war that leads you to take so cheerful a
view," urged Alva. "My master cannot but require the application of a
more efficient remedy, since the cause is common to Spain; for the
disease will spread, and Philip has no inclination to lose his crown, or,
perhaps, even his head." Catharine now insisted upon Alva's explaining
himself and disclosing his master's plan of action. This Alva declined to
do. Although Philip was as conversant with the state of France as she or
any other person in the kingdom, yet he preferred to leave to her to
decide upon the precise nature of the specific to be administered.
Catharine pressed the inquiry, but Alva continued to parry the question
adroitly. He asks if, since the Edict of Toleration, ground has been
gained or lost. Decidedly gained, she replies, and proceeds to
particularize. But Alva is confident that she is deceiving herself or
him: it is notorious that things are becoming worse every day.</p>

<p>"Would you have me understand," interrupts Catharine, "that we must
resort to arms again?"</p>

<p>"I see no present need of assuming them," answers Alva, "and my master
would not advise you to take them up, unless constrained by other
necessity than that which I now see."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, then, would Philip have me do?" asks Catharine. "Apply a prompt
remedy," answers Alva; "for sooner or later your enemies will, by their
own action, compel you to accept the wager of war, and that, probably,
under less favorable circumstances than at present. All Philip's thoughts
are intent upon the expulsion of that wretched sect of the Huguenots, and
upon restoring the subjects of the French crown to their ancient
obedience, and maintaining the queen mother's legitimate authority." "The
king, my son," responds Catharine, "publishes whatever edicts he pleases,
and is obeyed." "Then, if he enjoys such authority over his vassals,"
breaks in Isabella, "why does he not punish those who are rebels both
against God and against himself?"</p>

<p>That question Catharine did not choose to answer. Instead of it she had
some chimerical schemes to propose&mdash;a league between France, Spain, and
Germany, that should give the law to the world, and a confirmation of the
bonds that united the royal houses of France and Spain by two more
marriages, viz.: of Don Carlos to Margaret, her youngest daughter, and of
the Duke of Anjou to the Princess of Portugal. Alva, however, making
light of such projects, which could, according to his view, effect
nothing more than the bond already connecting the families, was not slow
in bringing the conversation back to the religious question. But he soon
had reason to complain of Catharine's coldness. She had already expressed
her mind fully, she said; and she resented, as a want of the respect due
to her, the hint that she was more indifferent than previously. She would
not fail to do justice, she assured him. That would be difficult,
rejoined Alva, with a chancellor at the head of the judiciary who could
not certainly be expected to apply the remedy needed by the unsound
condition of France. "It is his personal enemies," promptly replied
Catharine, "who, out of hatred, accuse L'Hospital of being a bad
Catholic." "Can you deny that he is a Huguenot?" asked the Spaniard. "I
do not regard him as such," calmly answered the French queen. "Then you
are the only person in the kingdom who is of that opinion!" retorted the
duke. "Even before I left France, and during the lifetime of my father,
King Henry," said Isabella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> interrupting with considerable animation,
"your Majesty knows that that was his reputation; and you may be certain
that so long as he is retained in his present office the good will always
be kept in fear and in disfavor, while the bad will find him a support
and advocate in all their evil courses. If he were to be confined for a
few days only in his own house, you would at once discover the truth of
my words, so much better would the interests of religion advance."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
But this step Catharine was by no means willing to take. Nor, when again
pressed by Alva, who dwelt much on the importance to Philip of knowing
her intentions as to applying herself in earnest to the good work, so as
to be guided in his own actions, would she deign to give any clearer
indications. Yet she avowed&mdash;greatly shocking the orthodox duke
thereby<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>&mdash;that she designed, instead of securing the acceptance of
the decrees of Trent by the French, to convene a council of "good
prelates and wise men," to settle a number of matters not of divine or
positive prescription, which the Fathers of Trent had left undecided.
Alva expressed his extreme astonishment, and reminded her of the Colloquy
of Poissy&mdash;the source, as he alleged, of all the present disgraceful
situation of France.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> But Catharine threw the whole blame of the
failure of that conference upon the inordinate conceit of the Cardinal of
Lorraine,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and persisted in the plan. The Spaniard came to the
conclusion that Catharine's only design was to avoid having recourse to
salutary rigor, and indulged in his correspondence with his master in
lugubrious vaticinations respecting the future.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>So far, then, was the general belief which has been adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> by the
greater number of historians up to our own days from being correct&mdash;the
belief that Catharine framed, at the Bayonne conference, with Alva's
assistance, a plan for the extermination of the Protestants by a massacre
such as was realized on St. Bartholomew's Day, 1572&mdash;that, on the
contrary, the queen mother refused, in a peremptory manner that disgusted
the Spanish fanatics, every proposition that looked like violence. That
we have not read the correspondence of Alva incorrectly, and that no
letter containing the mythical agreement of Catharine ever reached
Philip, is proved by the tone of the letters that passed between the
great agents in the work of persecution in the Spanish Netherlands.
Cardinal Granvelle, who, in his retreat at Besançon, was kept fully
informed by the King of Spain, or by his chief ministers, of every
important event, and who received copies of all the most weighty
documents, in a letter to Alonso del Canto expresses great regret that
Isabella and Alva should have failed in their endeavor to induce
Catharine de' Medici to adopt methods more proper than she was taking to
remedy the religious ills of France. She promised marvels, he adds, but
was determined to avoid recourse to arms, which, indeed, was not
necessary, if she would only act as she should. He was persuaded that the
plan she was adopting would entail the ruin of religion and of her son's
throne.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Festivities and pageantry.</div>

<p>While the policy of two of the most important nations on the face of the
globe, in which were involved the interests, temporal and eternal, of
millions of men, women, and children, formed the topic of earnest
discussion between two women&mdash;a mother and her daughter, the mother yet
to become infamous for her participation in a bloody tragedy of which she
as yet little dreamed&mdash;and a Spanish grandee doomed to an equally
unenviable immortality in the records of human suffering and human crime,
the city of Bayonne was the scene of an ephemeral gayety that might well
convey the impression that such merry-making was not only the sole object
of the conference, but the great concern of life.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Two nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
floundering in hopeless bankruptcy, yet found money enough to lavish upon
costly but unmeaning pageants, while many a noble, to satisfy an
ostentatious display, made drafts which an impoverished purse was little
able to honor. The banquets and jousts, the triumphal arches with their
flattering inscriptions, the shows in which allegory revelled almost to
madness&mdash;all have been faithfully narrated with a minuteness worthy of a
loftier theme.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> This is, however, no place for the detailed
description which, though entertaining, can be read to advantage only on
the pages of the contemporary pamphlets that have come down to us.</p>

<p>Yet, in the discussion of the more serious concerns of a great religious
and political party, we may for a moment pause to gaze at a single show,
neither more magnificent nor more dignified than its fellows; but in
which the youthful figure of a Bearnese destined to play a first part in
the world's drama, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> up to this time living a life of retirement in
his ancestral halls, first makes his appearance among the pomps to which
as yet he has been a stranger. The pride of the grandfather whose name he
bore, Henry of Navarre had been permitted, at that whimsical old man's
suggestion, to strengthen an already vigorous constitution by athletic
sports, and by running barefoot like the poorest peasant over the sides
of his native hills. "God designed," writes a companion of his later days
who never rekindles more of his youthful fire than when descanting upon
his master's varied fortunes, "to prepare an iron wedge wherewith to
cleave the hard knots of our calamities."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Later in childhood, when
both father and grandfather were dead, he was the object of the
unremitting care of a mother whose virtues find few counterparts or
equals in the women of the sixteenth century; and Jeanne d'Albret, in a
remarkable letter to Theodore Beza, notes with joy a precocious
piety,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> which, there is reason to fear, was not hardy enough to
withstand the withering atmosphere of a court like that with which he was
now making his first acquaintance.</p>

<p>One evening there was exhibited in a large hall, well lighted by means of
blazing torches, a tournament in which the knights fought on foot.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
From a castle where they held an enchanted lady captive, the knights
challengers issued, and "received all comers with a thrust of the pike,
and five blows with the sword." Each champion, on his arrival, endeavored
to enter the castle, but was met at the portal by guards "dressed very
fantastically in black," and repelled with "lighted instruments." Not a
few of the less illustrious were captured here. The more exalted in rank
reached the donjon, or castle-keep, but as they thought to set foot
within it, a trap-door opened and they too found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> themselves prisoners.
It fared better with the princes; for the success of each champion was
measured by a rigid heraldic scale. These passed the donjon, but, on a
bridge leading to the tower where slept the enchanted lady, a giant
confronted them, and in the midst of the combat the bridge was lowered,
and they were taken, as had been their predecessors. "The Duke of
Vendôme,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> son of the late duke, whom they call in France the Prince
of Navarre&mdash;a boy apparently ten or eleven years of age&mdash;crossed the
bridge, and the giant pretended to surrender; but he too was afterward
repulsed like the rest." The Duke of Orleans&mdash;whom the reader will more
readily recognize under the title of Duke of Anjou, which he, about this
time, received&mdash;next entered the lists. Naturally he penetrated further
than his namesake of Navarre, and "the giant showed more fear of him than
of the other;" but a cloud enveloped them both, and "thus the duke
vanished from sight." King Charles was the last to fight, and for his
prowess it was reserved for him to defeat the giant and deliver the
lady.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The confraternities.</div>

<p>The author of the pompous show had made a serious mistake. The giant
"League," before whom so many a champion failed, it was the lot not of
Charles, nor of Henry of Valois, but of the other Henry, of Navarre, to
overcome. That giant was already in existence, although still in his
infancy. For some time past the zealous papists, impatient of the
sluggish devotion of the court, had been forming "confréries," or
fraternities, whose members, bound together by a common oath, were
pledged to the support of the Roman Catholic religion.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The plan was
a dangerous one, and it shortly excited the apprehen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>sion of the king and
his mother. "I am told," Charles wrote in July, 1565, to one of his
governors, "that in a number of places in my realm there is a talk of
establishing an association amongst my subjects, who invite one another
to join it. I beg you to take measures to prevent that any be made for
any purpose whatsoever; but keep my subjects so far as possible united in
the desire to render me duty and obedience."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> And to prove the
sincerity of his intentions, the French king ordered the late Edict of
Pacification again to be proclaimed by public crier in the streets of the
seditious city of Paris&mdash;a feat which was successfully performed under
Marshal Montmorency's supervision, by the city provost, accompanied by so
strong a detachment of archers and arquebusiers, as effectually to
prevent popular disturbance.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Already there were restless spirits
that saw in another civil war fresh opportunity for the advancement of
their selfish interests. Months ago Villegagnon, the betrayer of the
Brazilian colony of Coligny, had written to Cardinal Granvelle, telling
him that he had resigned his dignities and offices in the French court,
and had informed Catharine de' Medici, "that until Charles was the
declared enemy of the enemies of God and of His church, he would never
again bear arms in his service."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> The vice-admiral, of whom modesty
was never a conspicuous virtue, went so far as to draw a flattering

Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> And Nicole de St. Rémy, whose only claim to honorable
mention was found in her oft-paraded boast that, as a mistress of Henry
the Second, she had borne him a son, and who held in France the congenial
post of a Spanish spy, suggested the marriage of the Cardinal of Bourbon
in view of the possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> contingency of the death of all Catharine's
sons.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The centre of all intrigue, the storehouse from which every
part of France was supplied with material capable of once more enkindling
the flames of a destructive civil war, was the house of the Spanish
resident envoy, Frances de Alava, successor of the crafty Chantonnay, the
brother of Granvelle. It was he that was in constant communication with
all the Roman Catholic malcontents in France.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Catharine endeavored
to check this influence, but to no purpose. The fanatical party were
bound by a stronger tie of allegiance to Philip, the Catholic king, than
to her, or to the Very Christian King her son. Catharine had particularly
enjoined upon the Cardinal of Lorraine to have no communication with
Granvelle or with Chantonnay, but the prelate's relations with both were
never interrupted for a moment.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Malta, and French civilities to the Sultan.</div>

<p>The fact was that, so far from true was it that a cordial understanding
existed between the courts of France and Spain, such as the mythical
league for the extirpation of heresy presupposes, the distrust and
hostility were barely veiled under the ordinary conventionalities of
diplomatic courtesy. While Catharine and Philip's queen were exchanging
costly civilities at Bayonne, the Turks were engaged in a siege of Malta,
which has become famous for the obstinacy with which it was prosecuted
and the valor with which it was repelled. Spain had sent a small
detachment of troops to the assistance of the grand master, Jean de la
Valette, and his brave knights of St. John, and the Pope had contributed
ten thousand crowns to their expenses.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Yet at this very moment an
envoy of the Sul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>tan was at the court of the Very Christian King of
France, greatly to the disgust of the Spanish visitors and pious
Catholics in general,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and only waited for the departure of Isabella
and Alva to receive formal presentation to the monarch and his
mother.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The constable espouses Cardinal Châtillon's defence.</div>

<p>Meantime, although the queen mother continued her policy of depriving the
Huguenots of one after another of the privileges to which they were
entitled, and replaced Protestant governors of towns and provinces by
Roman Catholics, her efforts at repression seemed, for the time at least,
to produce little effect. "The true religion is so rooted in France,"
wrote one who accompanied the royal progress, "that, like a fire, it
kindles daily more and more. In every place, from Bayonne hither, and for
the most part of the journey, there are more Huguenots than papists, and
the most part of men of quality and mark be of the religion." If the
writer, as is probable, was over-sanguine in his anticipations, he could
not be mistaken in the size of the great gathering of Protestants&mdash;full
two thousand&mdash;for the most part gentlemen and gentlewomen, which he
witnessed with his own eyes, brought together at Nantes to listen to the
preaching of the eloquent Perucel.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> And it was not an insignificant
proof of the futility of any direct attempt to crush the Huguenots, that
Constable Montmorency pretty plainly intimated that there were limits
which religious proscription must not transcend. The English ambassador
wrote from France, late in November, that the Pope's new nuncio had
within two days demanded that the red cap should be taken from the
Cardinal of Châtillon. But the latter, who chanced to be at court,
replied that "what he enjoyed he enjoyed by gift of the crown of France,
wherewith the Pope had nothing to do." The old constable was even more
vehement. "The Pope," said he, "has often troubled the quiet of this
realm, but I trust he shall not be able to trouble it at this time. I am
myself a papist; but if the Pope and his ministers go about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> again to
disturb the kingdom, <i>my sword shall be Huguenot</i>. My nephew shall leave
neither cap nor dignity which he has for the Pope, seeing the edict gives
him that liberty."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The court at Moulins.</div>

<p>Early in the following year, Charles the Ninth convoked in the city of
Moulins, in Bourbonnais, near the centre of France, an assembly of
notables to deliberate on the interests of the kingdom, which had not yet
fully recovered from the desolations of the first civil war. The
extensive journey, which had occupied a large part of the two preceding
years, had furnished him abundant evidence of the grievances under which
his subjects in the various provinces were laboring, and he now summoned
all that was most illustrious in France, and especially those noblemen
whom he had dismissed to their governments when about to start from his
capital, to assist him in discovering the best mode of relief. If the
Florentine Adriani could be credited, there were other and sinister
designs in the mind of the court, or, at least, in that of Catharine.
According to this historian, the plan of the second "Sicilian Vespers,"
resolved upon at Bayonne, was to have been put into execution at Moulins,
which, from its strength, was well suited for the scene of so sanguinary
a drama; but, although the Huguenot chiefs assembled in numbers, their
actions betrayed so much suspicion of the Roman Catholics, and it seemed
so difficult to include all in the blow, that the massacre was deferred
until the arrival of a more propitious time, which did not come until St.
Bartholomew's Day, 1572.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> I need not stop to refute a story which
presupposes the adoption of resolutions in the conference of Bayonne,
which we now know, from documentary evidence, were never for a moment
entertained by Catharine and her son the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feigned reconciliation of the Guises and Coligny.</div>

<p>So far from having any such treacherous design, in point of fact the
assembly of Moulins was intended in no small degree to serve as a means
of healing the dissensions existing among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> the nobles. The most serious
breaches were the feud between the Châtillons and the Guises on account
of the suspected complicity of Admiral Coligny in the murder of the late
duke, and that between Marshal Montmorency and the Cardinal of Lorraine,
arising out of the affray in January, 1565. Both quarrels were settled
amicably in the king's presence, with as much sincerity as generally
characterizes such reconciliations. Coligny declared on oath, in the
royal presence, that he was guiltless of Guise's murder, neither having
been its author nor having consented to it; whereupon the king declared
him innocent, and ordered the parties to be reconciled. The command was
obeyed, for Anne d'Este, Guise's widow, and Cardinal Charles of Lorraine
in turn embraced the admiral, in token of renewed friendship. How much of
meaning these caresses contained was to be shown six years later by the
active participation of the one in the most famous massacre which the
annals of modern history present, and by the exultant rejoicings in which
the other indulged when he heard of it. Young Henry of Guise, less
hypocritical than his mother and his uncle, held aloof from the
demonstration, and permitted the beholders to infer that he was quietly
biding his time for vengeance.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The chancellor introduces a measure for the relief of the
Protestants.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A new altercation between Lorraine and the chancellor.</div>

<p>An event of principal importance that occurred during the stay of the
court at Moulins was a fresh altercation between Lorraine and L'Hospital.
A tolerant but apparently unauthorized act of the chancellor furnished
the occasion. The Edict of Pacification had made provision for the
worship of the Huguenots in but a small number of places through the
kingdom. If living out of reach of these more favored localities, what
were they to do, that they might not be compelled to exist without the
restraints of religion during their lifetime, and to die without its
consolations, nor leave their children unbaptized and uninstructed in the
articles of their faith? L'Hospital proposed to remedy the evil by
permitting the Protestants, in such cases, to institute a species of
private worship in their houses, and had pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>cured the royal signature to
an edict permitting them to call in, as occasion might require, ministers
of the Gospel from other cities where their regular ministrations were
tolerated by the law of Amboise.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> This edict he had sent forthwith to
the different parliaments for registration. The Parliament of Dijon, in
Burgundy, however, instead of obeying, promptly despatched two
counsellors with a remonstrance to the king.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> On arriving at court,
the delegation at first found it impossible to gain the royal ear. In
such awe did the "maîtres de requêtes"&mdash;to whom petitions were
customarily entrusted&mdash;stand of the grave and severe chancellor&mdash;that
venerable old man with the white beard, whom Brantôme likened to another
Cato&mdash;that none was found bold enough to present the Burgundian
remonstrance. At last the delegates went to the newly-arrived cardinal,
and Lorraine readily undertook the task. Appearing in the royal council
he introduced the matter by expressing "his surprise that the Catholics
had no means of making themselves heard respecting their grievances." The
objectionable edict was read, and all the members of the council declared
that they had never before seen or heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> it. Cardinal Bourbon was
foremost in his anger, and declared that if the chancellor had the right
to issue such laws on his own responsibility, there was no use in having
a council. "Sir," said L'Hospital, turning to the Cardinal of Lorraine,
"you are already come to sow discord among us!" "I am not come to sow
discord, but to prevent you from sowing it as you have done in the past,
scoundrel that you are!" was the reply.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> "Would you prevent these
poor people, whom the king has permitted to live with freedom of
conscience in the exercise of their religion, from receiving any
consolation at all?" asked L'Hospital. "Yes, I intend to prevent it,"
answered the cardinal, "for everybody knows that to suffer such things is
to tolerate secret preaching; and I shall prevent it so long as I shall
have the power, in order to give no opportunity for the growth of such
tyrannical practices. And," continued he, "do you, who have become what
you now are by my means, dare to tell me that I come to sow discord among
you? I shall take good care to keep you from doing what you have done
heretofore." The council rose in anger, and passed into the adjoining
apartment, where Catharine, who had not recovered from a temporary
illness, strove to appease them as best she could. Charles ordered a new
meeting, and, after hearing the deputies from Dijon, the king,
conformably to the advice of the council, revoked the edict, and issued a
prohibition of all exercise of the Protestant religion or instruction in
its doctrines, save where it had been granted at Amboise. The chancellor
was strictly enjoined to affix the seal of state to no papers relating to
religious affairs without the consent of the royal council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the reformation at Cateau-Cambrésis.</div>

<p>For several years the Protestants in the northern provinces of France had
been busily communicating the religious views they had themselves
embraced to their neighbors in Artois, Flanders, and Brabant. This
intercourse became exceedingly close about the beginning of the year
1566;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> and its result was a renunciation of the papal church and its
worship, which was participated in by such large numbers, and effected so
instantaneously, that the friends and the foes of the new movement were
almost equally surprised. The story of this sudden outburst of the
reformatory spirit in Valenciennes, Tournay, and other places,
accompanied&mdash;as are all movements that take a strong hold upon the
popular feelings&mdash;with a certain amount of lawlessness, which expended
itself, however, upon inanimate images and held sacred the lives and
honor of men and women, has been well told in the histories of the
country whose fortunes it chiefly affected.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> I may be permitted,
therefore, to pass over these indirect results of Huguenot influence, and
glance at the fortunes of a border town within the present bounds of
France, and closely connected with the history of France in the sixteenth
century, of which little or no notice has been taken in this
connection.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Cateau-Cambrésis, famous for the treaty by which Henry
the Second bartered away extensive conquests for a few paltry places that
had fallen into the hands of the enemy, was, as its name&mdash;Chastel,
Château or Cateau&mdash;imports, a castle and a borough that had grown up
about it, both of them on lands belonging to the domain of Maximilian of
Bergen, Archbishop and Duke of Cambray, and Prince of the Holy Roman
Empire. It was smaller, but relatively far more important three hundred
years ago than at the present day. For several years a few "good
burgesses," with their families, had timidly studied the Holy Scriptures
in secret, restrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> from making an open profession of their faith by
the terrible executions which they saw inflicted upon the Protestants in
the Netherlands. But, encouraged by the toleration prevailing in France,
they began to cross the frontier, and to frequent the Huguenot
"assemblées" at Crespy, Tupigny, and Chauny. The distance was not
inconsiderable, and the peril was great. The archbishop had not only
written a letter, which was read in every parish church, forbidding the
singing of Marot's psalms and the frequenting of French conventicles, but
he had sent his spies to the conventicles to discover cases of
disobedience. The Huguenots of Cateau multiplied in spite of these
precautions. "The eyes of the aforesaid spies," writes a witness of the
events, "were so holden that they did not even recognize those with whom
they conversed." Yet, although the Huguenots met at home to read the
Bible and to "sing the psalms which were most appropriate to the
persecution and dispersion of the children of God," the town was as quiet
as it had ever been. A slight incident, however, revealed the intensity
of the fire secretly burning below the surface. A Huguenot minister was
discovered on Whitsunday, in an adjoining village, and brought to Cateau.
His captors facetiously told the suspected Protestants whom they met,
that they had brought them a preacher, and that they would have no
further occasion for leaving the town in quest of one. But the joke was
not so well appreciated as it might have been by the adherents of the
reformed faith, who seem by this time to have become extremely numerous.
The excitement was intense. When the bailiff of Cambrésis was detected,
not long after, stealing into the place by night, accompanied by some
sixty men, with the intention of carrying the preacher off to Cambray, he
met with unexpected resistance. A citizen, on his way to his garden
outside the walls, was the first to notice the guard of strange
arquebusiers at the gate, and ran back to give the alarm. The tocsin was
rung, and the inhabitants assembled in arms. It was now the turn of the
bailiff to be astonished, and to listen humbly to the remonstrances of
the people, indignant that he should have presumed to seize their gates
and usurp the functions of the local magistrates. However, the intruders,
after being politely informed that, ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>cording to strict justice, the
whole party might have been summarily put to death, were suffered to beat
a hasty retreat; not that so perfect a control could be put upon the
ardor of some, but that they "administered sundry blows with the flat of
their swords upon the back of the bailiff and a few of his soldiers."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interference of the Archbishop of Cambray.</div>

<p>The incident itself was of trifling importance, for the Huguenot minister
was promptly given up to the baron of the village where he had been
captured, and was taken by his orders to Cambray. But it led to serious
consequences. Threatened by the archiepiscopal city, the Protestants of
Cateau, afraid to go to the French preaching-places, sent for Monsieur
Philippe, minister of Tupigny, and held the reformed services just
outside of their own walls. Alarmed at the progress of Protestant
doctrines in his diocese, the Archbishop convened the estates of Cambray,
and, on the eighteenth of August, 1566, sent three canons of the
cathedral to persuade his subjects of Cateau to return to the Papal
Church, and to threaten them with ruin in case of refusal. Neither
argument nor menace was of any avail. The Protestants, who had studied
their Bibles, were more than a match for the priests, who had not; and,
as for the peril, the Huguenots quaintly replied: "Rather than yield to
your demand, we should prefer to have our heads placed at our feet." When
asked if they were all of this mind, they reiterated their determination:
"Were the fires made ready to burn us all, we should enter them rather
than accede to your request and return to the mass." These were brave
words, but the sturdy Huguenots made them good a few months later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The images and pictures overthrown.</div>

<p>Scarcely a week had passed before the news reached Cateau (on the
twenty-fifth of August) that the "idols" had been broken in all the
churches of Valenciennes, Antwerp, Ghent, Tournay, and elsewhere.
Although stirred to its very depths by the exciting intelligence, the
Protestant population still contained itself, and merely consulted
convenience by celebrating Divine worship within the city walls, in an
open cemetery. Unfortunately, however, the minister whom the reformed had
obtained was ill-suited to these troublous times. Monsieur Philippe,
unlike Calvin and the great majority of the ministers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> French
Protestant church, was rash and impetuous. Early the next morning he
entered the church of St. Martin, in company with three or four other
persons, and commenced the work of destruction. Altars, statues,
pictures, antiphonaries, missals, graduals&mdash;all underwent a common fate.
From St. Martin's the iconoclasts visited in like manner the other
ecclesiastical edifices of the town and its suburbs. Upon the ruins of
the Romish superstition the new fabric arose, and Monsieur Philippe
preached the same day in the principal church of Cateau, to a large and
attentive audience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Protestant claims.</div>

<p>And now began an animated interchange of proclamations on the one hand,
and of petitions on the other. The archbishop demanded the unconditional
submission of his subjects, and gave no assurances of toleration. The
Protestants declared themselves ready to give him their unqualified
allegiance, as their temporal sovereign, but claimed the liberty to
worship God. Maximilian referred to the laws and constitutions of the
Empire of which they formed an integral part. The burgesses answered by
showing that they had always been governed in accordance with the
"placards" issued by the King of Spain for his provinces of the
Netherlands, and that, whenever they had appealed in times past to the
chamber of the Empire, as for example at Spires, they had not only been
repelled, but even punished for their temerity.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> They claimed,
therefore, the benefit of the "Accord" made by the Duchess of Parma at
Brussels a few days previously, guaranteeing the exercise of the reformed
religion wherever it had heretofore been practised;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> while the
archbishop, when forced to declare himself, plainly announced that he
would not suffer the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> deviation from the Roman Catholic faith. In
their perplexity, the Protestants had recourse to the Count of Horn, at
Tournay, by whom they were received with the utmost kindness. The count
even furnished them with a letter to the archbishop, entreating him to be
merciful to them.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Archbishop's vengeance.</div>

<p>But nothing was further from the heart of Maximilian than mercy. He was
the same blind adherent of Cardinal Granvelle and his policy, whom, a
year or two before, Brederode, Hoogstraaten, and their fellow-revellers
had grievously insulted at a banquet given to Egmont before his departure
for Spain; the same treacherous, sanguinary priest who wrote to Granvelle
respecting Valenciennes: "We had better push forward and make an end of
all the principal heretics, whether rich or poor, without regarding
whether the city will be entirely ruined by such a course."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> On
Monday, the twenty-fourth of March, 1567, the troops of the archbishop
appeared before Cateau, and the same day the place was surrendered by the
treachery of some of the inhabitants. At once Cateau became a scene of
bloody executions. All that had taken part in the Protestant worship were
brought before a tribunal, which often tried, condemned, and punished
with death upon one and the same day. Monsieur Philippe, the rash
preacher, and one of his deacons seem to have been the first victims.
There was no lack of food for the gallows. To have been present at the
"preachings," to have partaken of the communion, to have maintained that
the Protestant was better than the Roman Catholic religion, to have
uttered a jest or drawn a caricature reflecting upon the Papal Church and
its ceremonies&mdash;any of these was sufficient reason for sending a man to
be hung or beheaded. The duchess's "moderation" had effected thus much,
that no one seems to have been burned at the stake. And so, at last, by
assiduous but bloody work, the Reformation was completely extirpated from
Cateau Cambrésis. It was, at least, a source of mournful satisfaction
that scarce one of the sufferers failed to exhibit great constancy and
pious resignation in view of death.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The idea of toleration is not understood.</div>

<p>Let us return from the Flemish borders to France proper, where,
notwithstanding attempts at external reconciliation, the breach between
the Protestants and their Roman Catholic neighbors was daily widening,
where, in fact, the elements of a new war were gathering shape and
consistency. It was becoming more and more difficult&mdash;especially for a
government of temporary shifts and expedients&mdash;to control the
antagonistic forces incessantly manifesting themselves. The idea of
toleration was understood by neither party. The Roman Catholics of
Provins were so slow to comprehend the liberty of conscience and
religious profession of which the Huguenots had wrung a concession in the
last edict by force of arms, that they undertook to prosecute the
Protestants for eating roast lamb and capons during Lent. With little
more appreciation of the altered posture of affairs, the Archbishop of
Sens (Cardinal Guise) initiated a trial against a heretical curate of
Courtenay, according to the rules of canon law, and the latter might have
stood but a poor chance to recover his freedom had not the Huguenot lord
of Courtenay seized upon the archbishop's "official" as he was passing
his castle, and held him as a hostage to secure the curate's
release.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot pleasantries.</div>

<p>It would be asserting too much to say that the Protestants were innocent
of any infraction upon the letter or spirit of the Edict of Amboise. They
would have been angels, not men, had they been proof against the
contagious spirit of raillery that infected the men of the sixteenth
century. Where they dared, they not unfrequently held up their opponents
to ridicule in the coarse style so popular with all classes.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Thus a
contemporary Roman Catholic recounts with indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> how Prince Porcien
held a celebration in Normandy, and among the games was one in which a
"paper castle" was assaulted, and the defenders, dressed as <i>monks</i>, were
taken prisoners, and were afterward paraded through the streets on asses'
backs.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> But these buffooneries were harmless sallies contrasted with
the insults with which the Protestants were treated in every town where
they were not numerically preponderating; nor were they anything more
than rare occurrences in comparison with the latter. This page of history
is compelled to record no violent commotion on the part of the reformed
population, save in cases where, as at Pamiers (a town not far south of
Toulouse, near the foot of the Pyrenees), they had been goaded to madness
by the government deliberately trampling upon their rights of worship, at
the instigation of the ecclesiastical authorities.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> A trifling
accident might then, however, be sufficient to cause their inflamed
passions to burst out; and in the disturbances that were likely to ensue,
little respect was usually paid to the churches or the monasteries. Such
are wont to be the unhappy effects of the denial of justice according to
the forms of established law. They would have been a hundred-fold more
frequent had it not been for the persistent opposition interposed by the
Huguenot ministers&mdash;many of them with Calvin carrying the doctrine of
passive submission to constituted authority almost to the very verge of
apparent pusillanimity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alarm of the Protestants.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts to murder the admiral and Prince Porcien.</div>

<p>From month to month the conviction grew upon the Protestants that their
destruction was agreed upon. There was no doubt with regard to the desire
of Philip the Second; for his course respecting his subjects in the
Netherlands showed plainly enough that the extermination of heretics was
the only policy of which his narrow mind could conceive as pleasing in
the sight of heaven. The character of Catharine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>&mdash;stealthy, deceitful,
regardless of principle&mdash;was equally well understood. Between such a
queen and the trusted minister of such a prince, a secret conference like
that of Bayonne could not be otherwise than highly suspicious. It is not
strange that the Huguenots received it as an indubitable fact that the
court from this time forward was only waiting for the best opportunity of
effecting their ruin; for even intelligent Roman Catholics, who were not
admitted into the confidence of the chief actors in that celebrated
interview, came to the same conclusion. Those who knew what had actually
been said and done might assure the world that the rumors were false; but
the more they asseverated the less they were believed. For it is one of
the penalties of insincere and lying diplomacy, that when once
appreciated in its true character&mdash;as it generally is appreciated in a
very brief space of time&mdash;it loses its persuasive power, and is treated
without much investigation as uniform imposture.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> With a suspicious
vigilance, bred of the very treachery of which they had so often been the
victims, the Huguenots saw signs of dangers that perhaps were not
actually in preparation for them. And certainly there was enough to
alarm. Not many months after the assembly of Moulins a cut-throat by the
name of Du May was discovered and executed, who had been hired to murder
Admiral Coligny, the most indispensable leader of the party, near his own
castle of Châtillon-sur-Loing.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The last day of the year there was
hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> a lackey, who pretended that the Cardinal of Lorraine had tried to
induce him to poison the Prince of Porcien; and, although he retracted
his statements at the time of his "amende honorable,"<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> his first
story was generally credited. The rumor was current that in December,
1566, Charles received special envoys from the emperor, the Pope, and the
King of Spain, warning him that, unless he should revoke his edict of
toleration, they would declare themselves his open enemies.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> This was
certainly sufficiently incredible, so far as the tolerant Maximilian was
concerned; but stranger mutations of policy had often been noticed, and,
as to Pius the Fifth and Philip, nothing seemed more probable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alva in the Netherlands.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Swiss levy.</div>

<p>With the opening of the year 1567 the portentous clouds of coming danger
assumed a more definite shape. In the neighboring provinces of the
Netherlands, after a long period of procrastination, Philip the Second
had at length determined to strike a decisive blow. The Duchess of Parma
was to be superseded in the government by a man better qualified than any
other in Europe for the bloody work assigned him to do. Ferdinando de
Toledo, Duke of Alva, in his sixtieth year, after a life full of
brilliant military exploits, was to undertake a work in Flanders such as
that which, two years before, he had recommended as the panacea for the
woes of France&mdash;a work with which his name will ever remain associated in
the annals of history. The "Beggars" of the Low Countries, like the
Huguenots in their last war, had taken up arms in defence of their
religious, and, to a less degree, of their civil rights. The "Beggars"
complained of the violation of municipal privileges and compacts,
ratified by oath at their sovereign's accession, as the Huguenots pointed
to the infringement upon edicts solemnly published as the basis of the
pacification of the country; and both refused any longer to submit to a
tyranny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> that had, in the name of religion, sent to the gallows or the
stake thousands of their most pious and industrious fellow-citizens. The
cause was, therefore, common to the Protestants of the two countries, and
there was little doubt that should the enemy of either prove successful
at home, he would soon be impelled by an almost irresistible impulse to
assist his ally in completing his portion of the praiseworthy
undertaking. It is true that the Huguenots of France were not now in
actual warfare with the government; but, that their time would come to be
attacked, there was every reason to apprehend. Hence, when the Duke of
Alva, in the memorable summer of 1567, set out from Piedmont at the head
of ten thousand veterans, to thread his way over the Alps and along the
eastern frontiers of France, through Burgundy and Lorraine, to the fated
scene of his bloody task in the Netherlands, the Protestants of France
saw in this neighboring demonstration a new peril to themselves. In the
first moments of trepidation, their leaders in the royal council are said
to have acquiesced in, if they did not propose, the levy of six thousand
Swiss troops, as a measure of defence against the Spanish general; and
Coligny, the same contemporary authority informs us, strongly advocated
that they should dispute the duke's passage.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Even if this statement
be true, they were not long in detecting, or believing that they had
detected, proofs that the Swiss troops were really intended for the
overthrow of Protestantism in France, rather than for any service against
the Duke of Alva. Letters from Rome and Spain were intercepted, we learn
from François de la Noue, containing evidence of the sinister designs of
the court.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon, a prince of the blood, a

danger.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Condé, who, within the past few months, had repeatedly
addressed the king and his mother in terms of remonstrance and petition
for the redress of the oppression under which the Huguenots were
suffering, but to no purpose, again supplicated the throne, urging in
particular that the levy of the Swiss be countermanded, since, if they
should come, there would be little hope of the preservation of the
peace;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> while Admiral Coligny, who found Catharine visiting the
constable, his uncle, at his palace of Chantilly, with faithful boldness
exposed to them both the impossibility of retaining the Protestants in
quiet, when they saw plain indications that formidable preparations were
being made for the purpose of overwhelming them. To these remonstrances,
however, they received only what they esteemed evasive answers&mdash;excuses
for not dismissing the Swiss, based upon representations of the danger of
some Spanish incursion, and promises that the just requests of the
Huguenots should receive the gracious attention of a monarch desirous of
establishing his throne by equity.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Shall we blame those sturdy, straightforward men, so long fed upon
unmeaning or readily-broken promises of redress, if they gave little
credit to the royal assurances, and to the more honeyed words of the
queen mother? Perhaps there existed no sufficient grounds for the
immediate alarm of the Huguenots. Perhaps no settled plan had been formed
with the connivance of Philip&mdash;no "sacred league" of the kind supposed to
have been sketched in outline at Bayonne&mdash;no contemplated massacre of the
chiefs, with a subsequent assembly of notables at Poitiers, and repeal of
all the toleration that had been vouchsafed to the Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> All
this may have been false; but, if false, it was invested with a wonderful

actions were concerned, all the effect of truth. At all events the
promises of the king could not be trusted. Had he not been promising,
again and again, for four years? Had not every restrictive ordinance,
every interpretation of the Edict of Amboise, every palpable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
infringement upon its spirit, if not upon its letter, been prefaced by a
declaration of Charles's intention to maintain the edict inviolate? In

employed to destroy the edict itself."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<blockquote><div class="sidenote">The Huguenot attempts at colonization in Florida.</div>

<p>The Huguenot expeditions to Florida have been so well sketched
by Bancroft and Parkman, and so fully set forth by their
latest historian, M. Paul Gaffarel, that I need not speak of
them in detail. In fact, they belong more intimately to
American than to French history. They owed their origin to the
enlightened patriotism of Coligny, who was not less desirous,
as a Huguenot, to provide a safe refuge for his fellow
Protestants, than anxious, as High Admiral of France, to
secure for his native country such commercial resources as it
had never enjoyed. "I am in my house," he wrote in 1565,
"studying new measures by which we may traffic and make profit
in foreign parts. I hope shortly to bring it to pass that we
shall have the best trade in Christendom." (Gaffarel, Histoire
de la Floride française, Paris, 1875, pp. 45, 46). But,
although the project of Huguenot emigration was conceived in
the brain of the great Protestant leader, apparently it was
heartily approved by Catharine de' Medici and her son. They
certainly were not averse to be relieved of the presence of as
many as possible of those whom their religious views, and,
still more, their political tendencies, rendered objects of
suspicion. "If wishing were in order," Catharine (Letter to
Forquevaulx, March 17, 1566, Gaffarel, 428) plainly told the
Spanish ambassador, on one occasion, "I would wish that all
the Huguenots were in those regions" ("si c'estoit souëter, ie
voudrois que touts les Huguenots fussent en ce pais-là"). In
the discussion that ensued between the courts of Paris and
Madrid, the queen mother never denied that the colonists went
not only with her knowledge, but with her consent. In fact,
she repudiated with scorn and indignation a suggestion of the
possibility that such considerable bodies of soldiers and
sailors could have left her son's French dominions without the
royal privity (Ibid., 427).</p>

<div class="sidenote">1562.</div>

<p>The first expedition, under Jean Ribault, in 1562, was little
more than a voyage of discovery. The main body promptly
returned to France, the same year, finding that country rent
with civil war. The twenty-six or twenty-eight men left behind
to hold "Charlesfort" (erected probably near the mouth of the
South Edisto river, in what is now South Carolina),
disheartened and famishing, nevertheless succeeded in
constructing a rude ship and recrossing the Atlantic in the
course of the next year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1564.</div>

<p>A second expedition (1564), under René de Laudonnière, who had
taken part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> in the first, was intended to effect a more
permanent settlement. A strong earthwork was accordingly
thrown-up at a spot christened "Caroline," in honor of Charles
the Ninth, and the colony was inaugurated under fair auspices.
But improvidence and mismanagement soon bore their legitimate
fruits. Laudonnière saw himself constrained to build ships for
a return to Europe, and was about to set sail when the third
expedition unexpectedly made its appearance (August 28, 1565),
under Ribault, leader of the first enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1565.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Massacre by Menendez.</div>

<p>Unfortunately the arrival of this fresh reinforcement was
closely followed by the approach of a Spanish squadron,
commanded by Pedro Menendez, or Melendez, de Abila, sent by
Philip the Second expressly to destroy the Frenchmen who had
been so presumptuous as to settle in territories claimed by
his Catholic Majesty. Nature seemed to conspire with their own
incompetency to ruin the French. The French vessels, having
gone out to attack the Spaniards, accomplished nothing, and,
meeting a terrible storm, were driven far down the coast and
wrecked. "Caroline" fell into the hands of Menendez, and its
garrison was mercilessly put to death. The same fate befell
the shipwrecked French from the fleet. Those who declared
themselves Roman Catholics were almost the only persons spared
by their pitiless assailants. A few women and children were
granted their lives; also a drummer, a hornblower, and a few
carpenters and sailors, whose services were valuable.
Laudonnière and a handful of men escaped to the woods, and
subsequently to Europe. About two hundred soldiers, who
threatened to entrench themselves and make a formidable
resistance, were able to obtain from Menendez a pledge that
they should be treated as prisoners of war, which, strange to
say, was observed. The rest&mdash;many hundreds&mdash;were consigned to
indiscriminate slaughter; Ribault himself was flayed and
quartered; and over the dead Huguenots was suspended a tablet
with this inscription: "Hung, not as Frenchmen, but as
Lutherans" (Gaffarel, 229; De Thou, iv. 113; Ag. d'Aubigné, i.
248). Spain and Rome had achieved a grand work. The chaplain
Mendoza could piously write: "The greatest advantage from our
victory, certainly, is the triumph our Lord grants us, which
will cause His Holy Gospel to be introduced into these
regions." (Mendoza, <i>apud</i> Gaffarel, 214).</p>

<p>The report of these atrocities, tardily reaching the Old
World, called forth an almost universal cry of horror.
Fair-minded men of both communions stigmatized the conduct of
Menendez and his companions as sheer murder; for had not the
French colonists of Florida been attacked before being
summoned to surrender, and butchered in cold blood after being
denied even such terms as were customarily accorded to Turks
and other infidels? Among princes, Philip alone applauded the
deed, and seemed only to regret that faith had been kept with
any of the detested Huguenots (Gaffarel, 234, 245). It has
been commonly supposed that whatever indignation was shown by
Catharine de' Medici and her son, was merely assumed in
deference to the popular clamor, and that but a feeble
remonstrance was really uttered. This supineness would be
readily explicable upon the hypothesis of the long
premeditation of the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. If the
treacherous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> murder of Admiral Coligny and the other great
Huguenot leaders had indeed been deliberately planned from the
time of the Bayonne conference in 1565, and would have been
executed at Moulins in 1566, but for unforeseen circumstances,
no protests against the Florida butchery could have been
sincere. On the other hand, if Catharine de' Medici was
earnest and persistent in her demand for the punishment of
Menendez, it is not conceivable that her mind should have been
then entertaining the project of the Parisian matins. The
extant correspondence between the French queen mother and her
envoy at the court of Madrid may fairly be said to set at rest
all doubts respecting her attitude. She was indignant,
determined, and outspoken.</p>

<p>So slowly did news travel in the sixteenth century, that it
was not until the eighteenth of February, 1566, that
Forquevaulx, from Madrid, despatched to the King of France a
first account of the events that had occurred in Florida
nearly five months before. The ambassador seems to have
expressed becoming indignation in the interviews he sought
with the Duke of Alva, repudiating with dignity the suggestion
that the blame should be laid upon Coligny, for having abused
his authority as admiral to set on foot a piratical expedition
into the territories of a friendly prince; and holding forth
no encouragement to believe that Charles would disavow
Coligny's acts. He told Alva distinctly that Menendez was a
butcher rather than a good soldier ("plus digne bourreau que
bon soldat," Forquevaulx to Charles IX., March 16, 1566,
Gaffarel, 425). He declared to him that the Turks had never
exhibited such inhumanity to their prisoners at Castelnovo or
at Gerbes&mdash;in fact, never had barbarians displayed such
cruelty. As a Frenchman, he assured the Spaniard that he
shuddered when he thought of so execrable a deed, and that it
appeared to him that God would not leave it unpunished (Ibid.,
426).</p>

<p>Catharine's own language to the Spanish ambassador, Don
Francez de Alava, was not less frank. "As their common
mother," she said, "I can but have an incredible grief at
heart, when I hear that between princes so closely bound as
friends, allies, and relations, as these two kings, and in so
good a peace, and at a time when such great offices of
friendship are observed between them, so horrible a carnage
has been committed on the subjects of my son, the King of
France. I am, as it were, beside myself when I think of it,
and cannot persuade myself that the king, your master, will
refuse us satisfaction" (Catharine to Forquevaulx, Moulins,
March 17th, Gaffarel, 427). Not content with this plain
talking to Alava, she "prayed and ordered" Forquevaulx to make
Philip himself understand her desires respecting "the
reparation demanded by <i>so enormous an outrage</i>." He was to
tell his Catholic Majesty that Catharine would never rest
content until due satisfaction was made; and that she would
feel "marvellous regret" should she not only find that all her
pains to establish perpetual friendship between the two kings
had been lost, but one day be reproached by Charles for having
suffered such a stain upon his reputation ("que ... j'aye
laissé faire une telle escorne à sa reputation." Gaffarel,
429).</p>

<p>Forquevaulx fulfilled his instructions to the very letter,
adding, on his own account, that in forty-one years of
military service he had never known so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> execrable an
execution. He seems also to have disposed effectually of the
Spanish claim to Florida through right of ancient discovery,
by emphasizing the circumstance that Menendez, after his
victory, thought it necessary to take formal possession of the
land. He informed Philip that no news could be more welcome to
the Huguenots than that the subjects of Charles had been
murdered by those very persons who were expected to strengthen
him by their friendship and alliance (Forquevaulx to
Catharine, April 9th, Gaffarel, 432). His words had little
effect upon any one at the Spanish court, save the young
queen, who felt the utmost solicitude lest her brother and her
husband should become involved in war with each other. ("Me
sembla qu'il tint à peu qu'elle ne pleurast son soul de
crainte qu'il ne survienne quelque alteration." Forquevaulx,
<i>ubi supra</i>, 430.)</p>

<p>But, although no progress was made toward obtaining justice,
the French government did not relax its efforts. Charles wrote
from Saint Maur, May 12, 1566, that his will was that
Forquevaulx should renew his complaint and insist with all
urgency upon a reparation of the wrong done him. "You will not
cease to tell them," said the king, "that they must not hope
that I shall ever be satisfied until I see such a reparation
as our friendship demands." (Gaffarel, 437.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sanguinary revenge of De Gourgues, April, 1568.</div>

<p>The French ambassador continued to press his claim, and, in
particular, to demand the release of the French prisoners,
even up to near the time when a private citizen, Dominique de
Gourgues, undertook to avenge his country's wrongs while
satisfying his thirst for personal revenge. De Gourgues was
not, as has usually been supposed, a Huguenot; he had even
been an adherent of Montluc and of the house of Guise
(Gaffarel, 265). But, having been captured in war by the
Spaniards, in 1566, he had been made a galley-slave. From that
time he had vowed irreconcilable hatred against the Catholic
king. He obtained a long-deferred satisfaction when, in April,
1568, he surprised the fort of Caroline, slew most of the
Spanish soldiers, and placed over the remainder&mdash;spared only
for the more ignominious punishment of hanging upon the same
trees to which Huguenots had been suspended&mdash;the inscription,
burned with a hot iron on a pine slab: "I do this not as to
Spaniards, nor as to seamen, but as to traitors, robbers, and
murderers." (The words are given with slight variations. See
"La Reprinse de la Floride par le Cappitaine Gourgue,"
reprinted by Gaffarel, 483-515; Agrippa d'Aubigné, i. 354-356;
De Thou, iv. 123-126.) </p></blockquote>

80). Sir Nicholas Throkmorton, who had long been a prisoner, held to be
exchanged against the hostages for the restitution of Calais, given in
accordance with the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, now returned home. Before
leaving, however, he had an altercation with his colleague, Sir Thomas
Smith, of which the latter wrote a full account. Sir Nicholas, it seems,
in his heat applied some opprobrious epithets to Smith, and even called
him "traitor"&mdash;a charge which the latter repudiated with manly
indignation. "Nay, thou liest, quoth I; I am as true to the queen as thou
any day in the week, and have done her Highness as faithful and good
service as thou." Smith to Cecil, April 13, 1564, State Paper Office.</p></div>

Troyes, where no expense was spared in providing tournaments and games
for his amusement. Just as he was about to leave the city, and was
already booted for his journey, he was detained for a little while that
he might witness a novel entertainment. He was taken to a garden where a
number of young girls, selected for their extraordinary beauty and
entirely nude, executed in his presence the most obscene dances. It was
two churchmen that are said to have provided the boy-king with this
infamous diversion&mdash;Cardinal Charles of Bourbon and Cardinal Louis of

and piety than the letter she wrote to the Cardinal of Armagnac, in reply
to a letter of the cardinal, dated August 18, 1563, intended to frighten
her into a return to the papal church. It was sent by the same messenger
who had brought the letter of Armagnac, and it has every mark of having
been Jeanne's own composition. Both letters are given in full by
Olhagaray, Hist. de Foix, Béarn, et Navarre, 536-543, and 544-551; a
summary in Vauvilliers, i. 347-362. The Queen of Navarre boldly avowed
her sentiments, but declared her policy to be pacific: "Je ne fay rien
par force; il n'y a ny mort ny emprisonnement, ny condemnation, qui sont
les nerfs de la force." But she refused to recognize Armagnac&mdash;who was
papal legate in Provence, Guyenne, and Languedoc&mdash;as having any such
office in Béarn, proudly writing: "Je ne recognois en Béarn que Dieu
auquel je dois rendre conte de la charge qu'il m'a baillée de son
peuple." The publication of these letters produced a deep impression
favorable to the Reformation.</p></div>

great disfavor. Upon a glass window at Limoges (made about the year 1564,
and still in existence, I believe) she is represented, by way of

am so strongly assured that religion is going to take a favorable turn in
France, that I know not what to say of it. The world in that quarter is
so light and variable, that no great grounds of confidence can be
assumed. But it is at any rate something that matters are not growing
worse." Letter to Bolwiller, April 9, 1564, Papiers d'état, etc., vii.

Henry of Navarre, afterward Henry the Fourth, of whose presence little
account was taken in consequence of his youth. (He was just eleven years

been likely to give him as authority, had this been the case. He only
says: "Les plus licentieux faisoient leur profit d'un terme du Duc d'Alve

chronicling the death of Louis, Cardinal of Guise, at Paris, March 29,
1578, he records the suggestive fact that "he was the last of the six

closely is the scriptural warning fulfilled, that "bloody and deceitful

Lorraine, as Mr. Henry White seems to suppose, Massacre of St.
Bartholomew, Am. edit., 187, 188) was the abettor of the massacre of

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>A treacherous peace or an open war was now apparently the only
alternative offered to the Huguenots. In reality, however, they believed
themselves to be denied even the unwelcome choice between the two. The
threatening preparations made for the purpose of crushing them were
indications of coming war, if, indeed, they were not properly to be
regarded, according to the view of the great Athenian orator in a
somewhat similar case, as the first stage in the war itself. The times
called for prompt decision. Within a few weeks three conferences were
held at Valéry and at Châtillon. Ten or twelve of the most prominent
Huguenot nobles assembled to discuss with the Prince of Condé and Coligny
the exigencies of the hour. Twice was the impetuosity of the greater
number restrained by the calm persuasion of the admiral. Convinced that
the sword is a fearful remedy for political diseases&mdash;a remedy that
should never be applied except in the most desperate emergency&mdash;Coligny
urged his friends to be patient, and to show to the world that they were
rather forced into war by the malice of their enemies than drawn of their
own free choice. But at the third meeting of the chiefs, before the close
of the month, they were too much excited by the startling reports
reaching them from all sides, to be controlled even by Coligny's prudent
advice. A great friend of "the religion" at court had sent to the prince
and the admiral an account of a secret meeting of the royal council, at
which the imprisonment of the former and the execution of the latter was
agreed upon. The Swiss were to be distributed in equal de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>tachments at
Paris, Orleans, and Poitiers, and the plan already indicated&mdash;the repeal
of the Edict of Toleration and the proclamation of another edict of
opposite tenor&mdash;was at once to be carried into effect. "Are we to wait,"
asked the more impetuous, "until we be bound hand and foot and dragged to
dishonorable death on Parisian scaffolds? Have we forgotten the more than
three thousand Huguenots put to violent deaths since the peace, and the
frivolous answers and treacherous delays which have been our only
satisfaction?" And when some of the leaders expressed the opinion that
delay was still preferable to a war that would certainly expose their
motives to obloquy, and entail so much unavoidable misery, the admiral's
younger brother, D'Andelot, combated with his accustomed vehemence a
caution which he regarded as pusillanimous, and pointedly asked its
advocates what all their innocence would avail them when once they found
themselves in prison and at their enemy's mercy, when they were banished
to foreign countries, or were roaming without shelter in the forests and
wilds, or were exposed to the barbarous assaults of an infuriated
populace.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> His striking harangue carried the day. The admiral
reluctantly yielded, and it was decided to anticipate the attack of the
enemy by a bold defensive movement. Some advocated the seizure of
Orleans, and counselled that, with this refuge in their possession,
negotiations should be entered into with the court for the dismissal of
the Swiss; others that the party should fortify itself by the capture of
as many cities as possible. But to these propositions the pertinent reply
was made that there was no time for wordy discussions, the controversy
must be settled by means of the sword;<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> and that, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> hundred towns
the Protestants held at the beginning of the last war, they had found
themselves unable to retain a dozen until its close. Finally, the prince
and his companions resolved to make it the great object of their
endeavors to drive the Cardinal of Lorraine from court and liberate
Charles from his pernicious influence. This object was to be attained by
dispersing the Swiss, and by conducting hostilities on a bold
plan&mdash;rather by the maintenance of an army that could actively take the
field,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> than by seizing any cities save a few of the most important.
On the twenty-ninth of September, the feast-day of St. Michael, the
Huguenots having suddenly risen in all parts of France, Condé and
Coligny, at the head of the troops of the neighboring provinces, were to
present themselves at the court, which would be busy celebrating the
customary annual ceremonial of the royal order. They would then hand to
the king a humble petition for the redress of grievances, for the removal
of the Cardinal of Lorraine, and for the dispersion of the Swiss troops,
which, instead of being retained near the frontiers of the kingdom which
they had ostensibly come to protect, had been advanced to the very
vicinity of the capital.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> It might be difficult to prevent the
enterprise from wearing the appearance of a plot against the king, in
whose immediate vicinity the cardinal was; but the event, if prosperous,
would demonstrate the integrity of their purpose.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The secret slowly leaks out.</div>

<p>The plan was well conceived, and better executed than such schemes
usually are. The great difficulty was to keep so impor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>tant a secret. It
was a singular coincidence that, as in the case of the tumult of Amboise,
over seven years before, the first intimations of their danger reached
the Guises from the Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> But the courtiers, whose minds were
taken up with the pleasures of the chase, and who dreamed of no such
movement, were so far from believing the report, that Constable
Montmorency expressed vexation that it was imagined that the Huguenots
could get together one hundred men in a corner of the kingdom&mdash;not to
speak of an army in the immediate vicinity of the capital&mdash;without the
knowledge of himself, the head of the royal military establishment; while
Chancellor de l'Hospital said that "it was a capital crime for any
servant to alarm his prince with false intelligence, or give him
groundless suspicions of his fellow-subjects."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>The news, however, being soon confirmed from other sources, a spy was
sent to Châtillon-sur-Loing to report upon the admiral's movements. He
brought back word that he had found Coligny at home, and apparently
engrossed in the labors of the vintage&mdash;so quietly was the affair
conducted until within forty-eight hours of the time appointed for the
general uprising.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> It was not until hurried tidings came from all
quarters that the roads to Châtillon and to Rosoy&mdash;a small place in Brie,
where the Huguenots had made their rendezvous&mdash;were swarming with men
mounted and armed, that the court took the alarm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flight of the court to Paris.</div>

<p>It was almost too late. The Huguenots had possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> Lagny and of the
crossing of the river Marne. The king and queen, with their suite, at
Meaux, were almost entirely unprotected, the six thousand Swiss being
still at Château-Thierry, thirty miles higher up the Marne. Instant
orders were sent to bring them forward as quickly as possible, and the
night of the twenty-eighth of September witnessed a scene of abject fear
on the part of the ladies and not a few of the gentlemen that accompanied
Charles and his mother. At three o'clock in the morning, under escort of
the Swiss, who had at last arrived, the court started for Paris, which
was reached after a dilatory journey that appeared all the longer because
of the fears attending it.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The Prince of Condé, who had been joined
as yet only by the forerunners of his army, engaged in a slight skirmish
with the Swiss; but a small band of four or five hundred gentlemen, armed
only with their swords, could do nothing against a solid phalanx of the
brave mountaineers, and he was forced to retire. Meanwhile Marshal
Montmorency, sent by Catharine to dissuade the prince, the admiral, and
Cardinal Châtillon from prosecuting their enterprise, had returned with
the message that "the Huguenots were determined to defeat the
preparations made to destroy them and their religion, which was only
tolerated by a conditional edict, revocable by the king at his
pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal Lorraine invites Alva to invade France.</div>

<p>The Cardinal of Lorraine did not share in the flight of the court to
Paris. Never able to boast of the possession of overmuch courage, he may
have feared for his personal safety; for it was not impossible that he
might be sacrificed by a queen rarely troubled with any feelings of
humanity, to allay the storm raging about the ship of state; or he may
have hoped to be of greater service to his party away from the
capital.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> However this may be, the Cardinal betook himself in hot
haste to the city of Rheims, but reached his palace only after an almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
miraculous escape from capture by his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Once in safety, he
despatched two messengers in rapid succession<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> to Brussels, and
begged Alva to send him an agent with whom he might communicate in
confidence. The proposals made when that personage arrived at Rheims were
sufficiently startling; for, after calling attention to Philip's rightful
claim to the throne of France, in case of the death of Charles and his
brothers, he offered in a certain contingency to place in the Spanish
monarch's hands some strong places that might prove valuable in
substantiating that claim. In return, the Cardinal wished Philip to
assume the defence of the papal church in France, and particularly
desired him to undertake the protection of his brothers and of himself.
The message was not unwelcome either to Alva or to his royal master. They
were willing, they said, to assist the King of France in combating the
Huguenots,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and they made no objection to accepting the cities. At
the worst, these cities would serve as pledges for the repayment of
whatever sums the King of Spain might expend in maintaining the Roman
Catholic faith in France. With respect to the propriety of Philip's
becoming the formal guardian of the Guises, Alva felt more hesitation,
for who knew how matters might turn out? And Philip, never quite ready
for any important decision, praised his lieutenant's delay, and
inculcated further procrastination.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> But the succession to the throne
of France was worthy of deep consideration. As Alva intimated, the famous
Salic law, under which Charles's sister Isabella was excluded from the
crown, was merely a bit of pleasantry, and force of arms would facilitate
the acknowledgment of her claims.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>The blow which the Huguenots had aimed at the tyrannical government of
the Cardinal of Lorraine had missed its mark, through premature
disclosure; but they still hoped to accomplish their design by slower
means. Shut up in Paris, the court might be frightened or starved into
compliance before the Roman Catholic forces could be assembled to relieve
the capital. With this object the Prince of Condé moved around to the
north side of the city, and took up his quarters, on the second of
October, in the village of Saint Denis. With the lower Seine, which, in
one of its serpentine coils, here turns back upon itself, and retreats
from the direction of the sea, in his immediate grasp, and within easy
striking distance of the upper Seine, and its important tributary the
Marne&mdash;the chief sources of the supply of food on which the capital
depended&mdash;the Prince of Condé awaited the arrival of his reinforcements,
and the time when the hungry Parisians should compel the queen to submit,
or to send out her troops to an open field. At the same time he burned
the windmills that stretched their huge arms on every eminence in the
vicinity. It was an ill-advised measure, as are all similar acts of
destruction, unless justified by urgent necessity. If it occasioned some
distress in Paris,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> it only embittered the minds of the people yet
more, and enabled the municipal authorities to retaliate with some color
of equity by seizing the houses of persons known or suspected to be
Huguenots, and selling their goods to defray part of the expense incurred
in defending the city.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenot movement alienates the king.</div>

<p>The attempt "to seize the person of the king"&mdash;for such the movement was
understood to be by the Roman Catholic party&mdash;was even more unfortunate.
It produced in Charles an alienation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> which the enemies of the
Huguenots took good care to prevent him from ever completely forgetting.
They represented the undertaking of Meaux as aimed, not at the
counsellors of the monarch, but at the "Sacred Majesty" itself, and Condé
and Coligny, with their associates, were pictured to the affrighted eyes
of the fugitive boy-king as conspirators who respected none of those
rights which are so precious in the view of royalty.</p>

<p>Meantime Catharine was not slow in resorting to the arts by which she was
accustomed to seek either to avert the evil consequences of her own
short-sighted policy, or to gain time to defeat the plans of her
opponents.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The Huguenots received a deputation consisting of the
chancellor, the Marshal de Vieilleville, and Jean de Morvilliers&mdash;three
of the most influential and moderate adherents of the court&mdash;through whom
Charles demanded the reason of the sudden uprising which causelessly
threatened his own person and the peace of the realm. The Huguenot
leaders replied by denying any evil design, and showing that they had
armed themselves only in self-defence against the manifested malice of
their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Subsequent interviews between Condé and the envoys of
Charles seemed to hold forth some hopes of peace. The king declared
himself ready to furnish the Protestants with proofs of the uprightness
of his intentions, and L'Hospital even exhibited the draft of an edict in
which their rights should be guaranteed. As this proved unsatisfactory,
the prince, at the chancellor's suggestion, submitted the requests of his
associates. These related to the banishment of the foreign troops, the
permission to come and present their petitions to the king, the
confirmation and maintenance of the past edicts, with the repeal of all
restrictive interpretations, the assembling of the states gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>eral, and
the removal of the burdensome imposts under which the people groaned, and
which were of advantage only to the crowd of Italians and others enjoying
extraordinary credit at court.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> If the first of these demands were
sufficiently bold, the last demand was little calculated to conciliate
Catharine, who naturally conceived herself doubly insulted by the covert
allusion to her own prodigality and by the reference to her countrymen.
She found no difficulty in inducing Charles to answer through a
proclamation sent by a herald to the confederates, commanding Condé,
Coligny, D'Andelot, La Rochefoucauld, Genlis, and the other leaders, by
name, to lay down the arms which they had taken up without his
consent.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Perceiving the mistake they had committed in making
requests which, although just and appropriate, were in part but
ill-suited to the times, the Protestants began to abate their demands.
Confining themselves to the matter of religion, they now petitioned only
for an unrestricted liberty of conscience and worship, confirmed by the
repeal of all ordinances or parliamentary decisions conflicting with it.
Their moderation inspired fresh hopes of averting the resort to arms, and
a new conference was held, between the Huguenot position and the city of
Paris, at the hamlet of La Chapelle Saint Denis. It was destined to be
the last. Constable Montmorency, the chief spokesman on the Roman
Catholic side, although really desirous of peace, could not be induced to
listen to the only terms on which peace was possible. "The king," he
said, "will never consent to the demand for religious toleration
throughout France without distinction of persons or places. He has no
intention of permanently tolerating two religions. His edicts in favor of
the Protestants have been intended only as temporary measures; for his
purpose is to preserve the old faith by all possible means. He would
rather be forced into a war with his subjects than avoid it by
concessions that would render him an object of suspicion to neighboring
princes."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>The simultaneous rising of the Huguenots in every quarter of the kingdom,
and the immediate seizure of many important cities, had surprised and
terrified the court; but it had also stimulated the Roman Catholic
leaders to put forth extraordinary efforts to bring together an army
superior to that of their opponents. Besides the Parisian militia and the
troops that flocked in from the more distant provinces, it was resolved
to call for the help repeatedly promised by Philip of Spain and his
minister, the Duke of Alva, when urging Charles to break the compacts he
had entered into with his reformed subjects. But the assistance actually
furnished fell far short of the expectations held forth. When Castelnau,
after two efforts, the first of which proved unsuccessful,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> reached
Brussels by a circuitous route, he found Alva lavish of good wishes, and
urgent, like his master, that no arrangement should be made with the
rebels before they had suffered condign punishment. But the envoy soon
convinced himself that all these protestations meant little or nothing,
and that the Spaniards were by no means sorry to see the French kingdom
rent by civil war. Ostensibly, Alva was liberal above measure in his
offers. He wished to come in person at the head of five thousand horse
and fifteen thousand foot, and make short work of the destruction of
Condé and his followers&mdash;a proposition which Castelnau, who knew that
Catharine was quite as jealous of Spanish as of Huguenot interference in
her schemes, felt himself compelled politely to decline; especially as
the very briefest term within which Alva professed himself ready to move
was a full month and a half. For seven or eight days the duke persisted
in refusing the Spanish troops that were requested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and in
insisting upon his own offer&mdash;precious time which, had it been husbanded,
might have changed the face of the impending battle before the walls of
Paris. When, at length, pressed by the envoy for a definite answer or for
leave to return, the duke offered to give him, in about three weeks'
time, a body of four or five thousand German lansquenets&mdash;troops that
would have been quite useless to Charles, who already had at his
disposition as many pikemen as he needed, in the six thousand Swiss. All
that Castelnau was finally able to bring home was an auxiliary force of
about seventeen hundred horse, under Count Aremberg. Even now, however,
the officer in command was bound by instructions which prevented him from
taking the direct road to the beleaguered capital of France, and
compelled him to pass westward by Beauvais and Poissy.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Saint Denis, Nov. 10, 1567.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The constable is mortally wounded.</div>

<p>The impatience of the Parisians, who for more than a month had been
inactive spectators, while their city was besieged by an insignificant
force and they were deprived of the greater part of their ordinary
supplies of food, could scarcely be restrained. They were the more
anxious for battle since they had received encouragement by the recapture
of a few points of some military importance along the course of the lower
Seine. Unable to resist the pressure any longer, Constable Anne de
Montmorency led out his army to give battle to the Huguenots on the tenth
of November, 1567. Rarely has such an engagement been willingly entered
into, where the disproportion between the contending parties was so
considerable. The constable's army consisted of sixteen thousand foot
soldiers (of whom six thousand were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> Swiss, and the remainder in part
troops levied in the city of Paris) and three thousand horse, and was
provided with eighteen pieces of artillery. To meet this force, Condé had
barely fifteen hundred hastily mounted and imperfectly equipped
gentlemen, and twelve hundred foot soldiers, gathered from various
quarters and scarcely formed as yet into companies. He had not a single
cannon. Of his cavalry, only one-fifth part were provided with lances,
the rest having swords and pistols. The greater number had no defensive
armor; and not a horse was furnished with the leathern <i>barbe</i> with which
the knight continued, as in the middle ages, to cover his steed's breast
and sides. The constable had wisely chosen a moment when the prince had
weakened himself by detaching D'Andelot, with five hundred horse and
eight hundred arquebusiers, to seize Poissy and intercept the Count of
Aremberg.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> In the face of such a disparity of numbers and equipment,
the Huguenots exhibited signal intrepidity.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> With Coligny thrown
forward on the right, in front of the village of Saint Ouen, and Genlis
on the left, near Aubervilliers, they opened the attack upon the
overwhelming numbers of the enemy, who descended from higher ground to
meet them. Marshal de Montmorency, the constable's eldest son, commanding
a part of the royal army, alone was successful, and had the valor of his
troops been imitated by the rest, the defeat of the Huguenots would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> have
been decisive; but the "Parisian regiment," despite its gilded
armor,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> yielded at the first shock of battle and fled in confusion to
the walls of Paris. Their cowardice uncovered the position of the
constable, and the cavalry of the Prince penetrated to the spot where the
old warrior was still fighting hand to hand, with a vigor scarcely
inferior to that which he had displayed more than fifty years earlier, in
the first Italian campaign of Francis the First.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> A Scottish
gentleman, according to the most probable account&mdash;for the true history
of the affair is involved in unusual obscurity&mdash;Robert Stuart by name,
rode up to Montmorency and demanded his surrender. But the constable,
maddened at the suggestion of a fourth captivity,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> for all reply
struck Stuart on the mouth, with the hilt of his sword, so violent a blow
that he broke three of his teeth. At that very moment he received,
whether from Stuart or from another of the Scottish gentlemen is
uncertain,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> a pistol-shot that entered his shoulder and inflicted a
mortal wound. At a few paces from him, Condé, with his horse killed under
him, nearly fell into the hands of the enemy. At last, however, his
partisans succeeded in rescuing him, and, while he retired slowly to
Saint Denis, the dying constable was carried to Paris, whither the Roman
Catholic army returned at evening.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Character of Anne de Montmorency.</div>

<p>The battle of Saint Denis was indecisive, and the victory was claimed by
both sides. The losses of the Huguenots and the Roman Catholics were
about equal&mdash;between three and four hundred men&mdash;although the number of
distinguished Huguenot noblemen killed exceeded that of the slain
belonging to the same rank in the royal army. If the possession of the
field at the end of the day, and the relief of Paris, be taken as
sufficient evidence, the honor of success belonged to the Roman Catholic
army. But the loss of their chief commander far more than counterbalanced
any advantage they may have gained. Not that Anne de Montmorency was a
general of remarkable abilities. Although he had been present in a large
number of important engagements ever since the reign of Louis the
Twelfth, and had proved himself a brave man in all, he was by no means a
successful military leader. The late Duke of Guise had eclipsed his
glory, and in a much briefer career had exhibited much more striking
tactical skill. The battle of Saint Denis, it was alleged by many, had
itself been marred by his clumsy disposition of his troops. Proud and
overbearing in his deportment, he alienated even those with whom his warm
attachment to the Roman Catholic Church ought to have made him popular.
Catharine de' Medici, we have seen, had long been his enemy. In like
manner, even the bigoted populace of Paris forgot the pious exploits that
had earned him the surname of "le Capitaine Brûlebanc," and remembered
only his suspicious relationship to Cardinal Châtillon, Admiral Coligny,
and D'Andelot, those three intrepid brothers whose uncompromising
morality and unswerving devotion to their religious convictions made
them, even more than the Prince of Condé, true representatives of the
dreaded Huguenot party.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>But the loss of the principal general at this important juncture in
military affairs dealt a severe blow to the Roman Catholic cause. There
was no other leader of sufficient prominence to put forth an indisputable
claim to succeed him. Catharine, not sorry to be relieved of so
formidable a rival, was resolved that he should have no troublesome
successor. Accordingly she induced the king to leave the office of
constable vacant, and to confer upon her second surviving son, Henry,
Duke of Anjou, whose unscrupulous character had already made him her
favorite, the supreme command of the army, with the less ambitious title
of royal lieutenant-general.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>The death of the constable, who survived his wound only a single day, and
the subsequent divisions of the court, furnished the Prince of Condé with
an immunity from attack, of which, in view of his great inferiority in
number of troops, he deemed it most prudent to take advantage by promptly
retiring from his exposed position. Besides this, he had now an
imperative summons to the eastern frontier of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Protestant princes of Germany determine to aid the
Huguenots.</div>

<p>At the very commencement of the war the Protestants had sent a deputation
to the German princes to solicit their support in a struggle in which the
adherents of the Augsburg Confession were no less vitally interested than
the reformed. But Bochetel, Bishop of Rennes, the envoy of Charles the
Ninth, had so skilfully misrepresented the true character of the contest,
that the Landgrave of Hesse, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg,
persuaded that political motives, rather than zeal for religion, were the
occasion of the revolt, had refused to assist the Huguenots, while
permitting William of Saxony and the Marquis of Baden to levy troops for
the king. To the Elector Palatine, Frederick the Third, surnamed "the
Pious," who from a Lutheran had become a Calvinist, a special ambassador
was despatched in the person of M. de Lansac. This gentleman, by more
than usually reckless misstatements, sought to persuade the elector to
abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> the enterprise of assistance which he had intended to intrust to
his second son, John Casimir. But his falsehoods were refuted by the
straightforward exposé of the prince's agents,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and Lansac was only
so far successful that the elector consented to delay the departure of
the troops until he had sent a messenger to France to acquaint himself
with the true state of the case. It needed no more than this to determine
him; for the minister whom the elector had intrusted with the commission,
after visiting successively the court of the king and the camp of the
prince of Condé, returned with certain proofs that the representations of
Bochetel and of Lansac were altogether false.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Consequently the army
which John Casimir had gathered was speedily despatched to furnish Condé
the support the Huguenots so much needed.</p>

<p>In the letter which the elector palatine sent about the same time to the
King of France, the motives of this apparently inimical action are
vividly set forth. His envoy, the Councillor Zuleger, says the elector,
has made a careful examination. Lansac and his companion have
industriously circulated throughout Germany the report that the Edict of
Toleration is kept entire, that Condé and the Protestants have no other
object in view but a horrible rebellion against Charles to deprive him of
his crown, and that the prince has had money struck as if he were king
himself.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> But Zuleger has, on the contrary, reported that when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> in
the presence of the royal council, he asked for proofs of Condé's
intention to make himself king, Catharine de' Medici replied that it was
a "mockery," and that, though Condé had struck money, both in the late
and in the present troubles, it was with the king's inscription and arms,
and not as though he were himself king. So far from that, Zuleger
declares that, during the eleven days of his stay in the prince's camp,
he heard prayers offered morning and night for the preservation of the
state and for the king's safety. As to the maintenance of the edict, the
constable before his death openly affirmed that Charles would not permit
a free exercise of religion, and never intended the Edict of Orleans to
be other than <i>provisional</i>. Indeed, the queen-mother remarked to Zuleger
that it is a privilege of the French monarchs never to make a perpetual
edict; to which Charles, who was present, promptly responded, "Pourquoi
non?"<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>It was to form a junction with the force brought by John Casimir that the
prince now raised the siege of Paris, two or three days subsequently to
the battle of Saint Denis,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and after that D'Andelot, disappointed in
having had no share in the engagement, had scoured the field, driving
back into Paris an advanced guard of the enemy, and burning, by way of
bravado, some windmills in the very suburbs.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenots go to meet the Germans.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Treacherous diplomacy.</div>

<p>The purpose of the Huguenot leaders could not be mistaken, and Catharine
was determined to frustrate it. The chief object at which all her
intrigues now aimed was to delay the Prot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>estant army in its march toward
Lorraine, until the Duke of Anjou, at the head of a force which was daily
gaining new accessions of strength from the provinces, should be able to
overtake Condé and bring on a general and decisive action. From Saint
Denis the Huguenots had first followed the course of the upper Seine to
Montereau. Crossing the stream at this point, Coligny, as usual
commanding the vanguard, had, at Pont-sur-Yonne, received a powerful
detachment, under the Count of La Rochefoucauld, which had made its way
from the provinces of Poitou, Saintonge, and Guyenne, across the valley
of the Loire, to reinforce the Prince of Condé's army.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Having
effected a junction, the united body had changed its course, recrossed
the Seine, and countermarched to the river Marne, at Épernay and Châlons.
Coligny's skilful man&oelig;uvre had disappointed the queen's plan, and she
resorted to her accustomed arts of negotiation. So flattering, indeed,
were her promises, that Condé, had he not been restrained by the more
prudent counsels of his associates (among whom the Vidame of Chartres was
most urgent in his protests against so suicidal a policy), would
instantly have relaxed the sinews of war.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> A petty act of treachery
served to open his eyes, and to prevent the Protestants from involving
themselves in more serious disaster; for the Count de Brissac took
advantage of a three days' armistice to fall unexpectedly upon an outpost
of the prince's army and gain an advantage, which was duly magnified by
report at Paris into a brilliant victory.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Unabashed by this
incident, Catharine soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> after renewed her seductive offers (on the
twentieth of December, 1567). She invited a conference with the Cardinal
of Châtillon and other Protestant leaders, and herself went so far as
Châlons to meet them. Thence the scene of the negotiations was
transferred to Vincennes, in the vicinity of Paris, and for a time the
prospect of reconciliation was bright and encouraging. The king's envoys
consented to the re-establishment of the Edict of Amboise, without any
past or future restrictions, until the decision of the religious question
by that mythical assembly which, like a mirage of the desert, ever and
anon arose to entrance and disappoint the longing eyes of thoughtful men
in this century&mdash;a free, universal, and legitimate council of the Church.
But the hopes founded on these promises were as illusory as any
previously conceived. Instead of a formal and unambiguous ratification of
the terms by Charles himself, the Cardinal of Châtillon was treated only
to complaints about the causeless rising of the Protestants, and
expressions of astonishment that Condé had not instantly countermanded
the approach of the German auxiliaries on receiving the king's gracious
proffers.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alva's view of accommodations with heretics.</div>

<p>Meantime Catharine was not idle in soliciting foreign aid. The Duke
d'Aumale&mdash;who had also marched to Lorraine, in order to meet the Germans
coming to the assistance of the Roman Catholics, under command of the
Marquis of Baden&mdash;not being strong enough to block the passage of Condé's
troops, Catharine wrote to Alva, begging him to send to the duke, in this
emergency, two thousand arquebusiers. She warned him that if, through the
failure to procure them, the German reiters of John Casimir should be
permitted to enter the kingdom, she would hold herself exonerated, in the
sight of God and of all Christian princes, from the blame that might
otherwise attach to her for the peace which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> would be compelled to
make with the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Alva, in reply, declined to send the Spanish
arquebusiers, who, he said, were needed by him, and could do little good
in France; but he added that, if Aumale, who was a soldier, would
guarantee with this accession to stop the reiters, he would let them go,
useful as they were in the Netherlands. As to the accommodation with the
Huguenots, which Catharine suggested, he viewed it as a frightful evil,
and exclaimed "that it was better to have a kingdom ruined in preserving
it for God and the king, than to retain it whole, but without religion,
for the advantage of the devil and his partisans, the heretics."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé and John Casimir meet in Lorraine.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Generosity of the Huguenot troops.</div>

<p>About the beginning of the new year the foot-sore Huguenot army, after
nearly two months of tedious marches through a hostile country, and no
less tedious negotiations, reached Lorraine, only to find that their
German allies had not yet arrived. Sick at heart, with a powerful enemy
hanging on their rear, and seeking only an opportunity to make a sudden
descent upon them, many of the Huguenots were disposed to take advantage
of the proximity of the German cities to disperse and find a refuge
there. But Condé, with his never-failing vivacity and cheerfulness, and
Coligny, with his "grave words," succeeded in checking their despondency
until the welcome news of John Casimir's approach was announced. He
brought six thousand five hundred horse, three thousand foot, and four
cannon of moderate size. His arrival did not, however, prove an occasion
of unmingled satisfaction. The reiters, serving from purely mercenary
motives, demanded the immediate payment of one hundred thousand crowns,
promised as a first instalment on account of their wages, and were
resolved to go no farther without receiving it. The Prince of Condé had
but two thousand crowns to meet the engagement. In this new perplexity
the Huguenots, from the leaders down to the very lowest, gave a noble
illustration of devotion to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> religion's cause. Condé and Coligny
set the example by giving up their plate to replenish the empty coffers
of the army. The captains urged, the ministers of the gospel preached, a
generous sacrifice of property in the common interest. Their exhortations
did not fall upon dull ears. Money, gold chains, silver, articles of
every description, were lavishly contributed. An unpaid army sacrificed
its own private property, not only without a murmur, but even joyfully.
The very camp-servants vied with their masters, and put them to shame by
their superior liberality.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> In a short time a sum was raised which,
although less than what had been pledged, contented the reiters, who
declared themselves ready to follow their Huguenot fellow-soldiers into
the heart of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Well might an army capable of such heroic
contempt for personal gain or loss be deemed invincible!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The march toward Orleans.</div>

<p>And now, with feelings widely different from those which had possessed
them in the journey toward Lorraine&mdash;a movement too nearly akin to a
flight to inspire anything but disgust&mdash;the Huguenot soldiers, over
twenty thousand strong, turned their faces once more westward. Their late
pursuers, no longer seeking an engagement where the result might be worse
than doubtful, confined themselves to watching their progress from a safe
distance. As all the cities upon their route were in the hands of the
Roman Catholics, the Huguenots were forced to take more circuitous and
difficult paths through the open country. But the dispositions made by
Coligny are said to have been so thorough and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> masterly, that they
travelled safely and in comfort.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Not that the soldiers, dispersed at
night through the villages, were freed from the necessity or the
temptation to pillage;<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> for the poor farmers, robbed of the fruits of
their honest toil, frequently had good reason to complain that those who
had recently dispensed their own treasure with so liberal a hand were
even more lavish of the property of others. But they were far more
merciful and considerate toward their enemies than the Roman Catholic
army to its friends. Even a curate of Brie&mdash;no very great lover of the
Huguenots, who relates with infinite gusto the violation of Huguenot
women by Anjou's soldiers<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>&mdash;admits that, excepting in the matter of
the plundering of the churches and the distressing of priests, the Roman
Catholics were a little worse than the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Michelade" at Nismes.</div>

<p>Leaving the Huguenot army on its march toward Orleans, let us glance at
the operations of the party in other quarters of the kingdom. Southern
France, where the Protestants were most numerous, and where the excitable
character of the people disposed them more easily than elsewhere to
sudden outbreaks, was not behind the north in rising at the appointed
time (September, 1567). At Nismes, indeed, a furious commotion broke
out&mdash;the famous "Michelade," as it was called, because it immediately
followed the feast-day of St. Michael&mdash;a commotion whose sanguinary
excesses gave it an unenviable notoriety, and brought deep disgrace upon
the Protestant cause. Here the turbulent populace was encouraged by the
report that Lyons was in friendly hands, and maddened by the intelligence
that, besides the common dangers impending over all the Huguenots of
France, the Huguenots of Nismes had more particular occasion for fear in
the troops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> the neighboring Comtât Venaissin. These troops, it was
said, had been summoned by the bishop and chapter of the cathedral of
Nismes. The mob accordingly took possession of the city, closing the
gates, and imprisoning a large number of persons&mdash;consuls, priests, and
other obnoxious characters. That night the cathedral and the
chapter-house witnessed a wild scene of destruction. Pictures of the
saints, and altars, including everything associated with Roman Catholic
worship, were ruthlessly destroyed. But the most terrible event occurred
in the episcopal palace. The bishop was saved from capture and certain
death by the intervention of a courageous man, himself a Protestant; but
others were less fortunate. No fewer than eighty prisoners, brought in
detachments to the court of the palace, were butchered in rapid
succession, and their corpses thrown promiscuously into a well. The next
morning the Protestant pastors and elders assembled, and, sending to the
ringleaders a minister and a deacon, begged them to discontinue their
horrible work. Already, however, had returning shame made everybody
unwilling to avow his complicity in the crime. Quiet was restored. The
Protestant seneschal and council released such prisoners as had escaped
the fate of their comrades, and the bishop himself was sent away under an
escort to a place of safety, by order of the very judge whom the clergy
had, a year before, sought to deprive of his office as a heretic.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
Nismes remained in the hands of the Protestants through the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot successes in the south and west.</div>

<div class="sidenote">La Rochelle secured for Condé.</div>

<p>Meanwhile more important movements took place. René of Savoy, son of the
Count de Tende, but better known as Cipierre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> was Condé's agent in
assembling the Huguenots of Provence; but Paul de Mouvans, whom we have
met with before in this history, was the real hero of the region. In
Dauphiny, Montbrun commanded. In Bourbonnais and the neighboring
provinces west of the Rhône, Parcenac and Verbelai raised three thousand
foot and five hundred horse, but sustained so severe a loss while passing
through Forez, that the number was soon reduced to barely twelve hundred.
Nearer the Pyrenees, seven thousand men were assembled, known as "the
army of the viscounts," to which further reference will shortly be made.
Lyons, one of the Huguenot strongholds in the first war, the Protestants
failed to capture.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> But Orleans was secured by the skill of François
de la Noue, a young champion whose name was destined long to figure in
the most brilliant deeds of arms of his party, both in France and in the
Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> In the west, too, the Huguenots made the most
important gain of the war in the city of La Rochelle, for the next
half-century and more their secure refuge on approach of danger.</p>

<p>This place, strong by nature, surrounded by low, marshy grounds,
rendering it almost unapproachable from the land side, save by the
causeways over which the roads ran, with a large and convenient harbor
and with easy access to the sea, was already rich and populous. The
citizens of La Rochelle were noted for their independent spirit,
engendered or fostered by their maritime habits. Although the great
importance of the city dates from the civil wars, when its wharves
received the commerce driven from older ports, and when its privateers
swept the shores of Brittany and the bosom of the English channel, it had
long boasted extraordinary privileges, among which the most highly prized
was the right to refuse admission to a royal garrison.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Besides this,
the citizens were accustomed to choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> three candidates for the office
of major, from whom the king or the royal governor made his selection;
and the magistrate thus appointed enjoyed an authority which the
Rochellois would scarcely concede to their monarch.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> La
Rochelle&mdash;whose former orthodoxy Father Soulier attempts to establish by
instancing the sentence which the "présidial" of the city pronounced in
1552 against some Protestants, condemning them to be dragged on a hurdle
with a fagot of sticks bound to their backs, and afterward to be burned,
one of them alive<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>&mdash;had been so far affected by the progress of the
Reformation, that it was perhaps only the fear of losing its trade and
privileges that prevented it from openly siding with Condé in the first
religious war.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> By this time, however, Protestantism had struck such
deep roots, that one of the three candidates for the mayoralty, at the
Easter elections of 1567, was Truchares, a political Huguenot. The king
was, indeed, warned of his sentiments; but the royal governor, M. de
Jarnac, supported his claims, and Truchares received the requisite
confirmation.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Still La Rochelle hesitated to espouse the Protestant
side. It was not until midwinter,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> that Condé, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>turning from
Lorraine, commissioned M. de Sainte-Hermine to assume command of the city
in his name; and on the tenth of February, 1568, the mayor and échevins
of La Rochelle opened their gates to their new friends, with
protestations of their purpose to devote their lives and property to the
advancement of the common cause. "The sequel proved only too clearly,"
writes a Roman Catholic historian, "that they were very sincere in their
promises; for, having soon after demolished all the churches, they
employed the materials to fortify this city in such a manner that it
served from this time forward as a citadel for the Protestants, and as a
secure retreat for all the apostates and malcontents of the kingdom until
it was reduced by Louis the Thirteenth."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spain and Rome oppose the negotiations for peace.</div>

<p>Meantime the irresolute queen mother, always oscillating between war and
peace, had again begun to treat with the Huguenots. Between the fifth and
twentieth of January she held repeated interviews with Cardinal
Châtillon, D'Esternay, and Téligny. The bigots took the alarm. The Papal
Nuncio and the ambassadors of Spain and Scotland did their utmost "to
impeach the accord." A post arrived from Philip the Second, offering a
hundred thousand crowns of gold if Charles would continue the war. The
doctors of the Sorbonne remonstrated. All united in a common cry that "it
was impossible to have two religions in one realm without great
confusion." Poor Charles was so moved by the stale falsehood, as well as
by the large promises made him, that he sent the Protestant envoys word
that he would treat no further unless Condé and his "complices" would
send the reiters back to Germany, and, wholly disarming, come to him with
their ordinary retinues to purge themselves of the attempt made at Meaux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cardinal Santa Croce demands that Cardinal Châtillon be

<div class="sidenote">Retort of Marshal Montmorency.</div>

<p>Even this amount of complaisance on the part of the weak monarch,
however, did not satisfy Cardinal Santa Croce, who, on one occasion
entering the council chamber (on the twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> of January), boldly
demanded the fulfilment of the queen mother's promise to surrender
Cardinal Châtillon into the Pope's hands. Catharine did not deny the
promise, but interposed the plea that the present was a very unsuitable
time, since Châtillon had come to court upon the king's safe-conduct. To
this the churchman replied that no respect ought to be had toward the
Cardinal, for he was "an excommunicate person," condemned of schism, and
dead in the eyes of the law. Up to this point the Duke de Montmorency,
who was present, had kept silence; but now, turning to the queen mother,
he is reported by the English ambassador to have made a pungent address.
"But, madam," he said, "is it possible that the Cardinal Châtillon's
delivery should come in question, being warranted by the king and your
Majesty to the contrary, and I myself being made a mean therein?
Wherefore this matter is odious to be talked of, and against the law of
arms and all good civil policy; and I must needs repute them my enemies
who go about to make me falsify my promise once made." After these plain
words Santa Croce "departed without attaining his most cruel
request."<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">March of the viscounts to meet Condé.</div>

<p>During the first few months after the assumption of arms, the Huguenots
of southern France, surrounded by domestic enemies, had confined
themselves to attempting to secure their own safety and that of their
neighbors, by taking the most important cities and keeping in check the
forces of the provincial governors&mdash;an undertaking in which they met with
more success in the districts bordering upon the Mediterranean than in
those adjoining the Bay of Biscay. These events, although in themselves
important and interesting, would usurp a dispropor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>tionate place in this
history. While Condé was absent from the vicinity of the capital,
however, a body of six thousand troops, drawn from the army of the
<i>viscounts</i>, under Mouvans and other experienced southern leaders,
undertook a hazardous march from Dauphiny, intending to join the prince's
army at Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The cities were in the possession of the enemy, the
fords were carefully guarded, the entire country was hostile. But the
perils which might have deterred less resolute men only enhanced the
glory of the success of the gallant Huguenots. Abandoned by a
considerable number of their comrades, who preferred a life of plunder to
a fatiguing journey under arms, they met (on the eighth of January, 1568)
and defeated, with a force consisting almost exclusively of infantry, the
cavalry which the governor of Auvergne and the local nobility had
assembled near the village of Cognac<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> to dispute their passage.
Continuing their march, they reached Orleans in time to relieve that
city, to whose friendly protection against the Roman Catholic bands of
Martinengo and Richelieu that infested its neighborhood and threatened
its capture Condé and the other Huguenot leaders of the north had
entrusted their wives and children.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Chartres.</div>

<p>Having stopped a brief time to rest the soldiers after the protracted
march, the viscounts turned their victorious arms against the city of
Blois. After the surrender of this place, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> proceeded down the
valley of the Loire, and were about to take Montrichard, on the Cher,
when recalled by Condé. The prince had by forced marches anticipated the
army of Anjou, resolving to strike a blow which should be felt at the
hostile capital itself, and had selected Chartres, an important city
about fifty miles in a south-westerly direction from Paris, as the most
convenient place to besiege.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Rapid, however, as had been his
advance&mdash;and a part of his army had travelled sixty miles in two
days&mdash;the enemy had sufficient notice of his intention to throw into the
city a small force of soldiers; and when Condé arrived before the walls
(on the twenty-fourth of February, 1568), he found the place prepared to
sustain an attack, in which the courage of the assailants was equalled by
the skill and resolution of the defenders. As usual, the Huguenots were
badly off for artillery; the united armies could only muster five
siege-pieces and four light culverines. "For, although the Catholics
esteem the Huguenots to be 'fiery' men," says a quaint old writer, who
was as ready with his sword as with his pen, "they have always been
poorly provided with such implements. Nor have they, like the former, a
Saint Anthony, who, they say, presides over the element in
question."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>The operations of the siege of Chartres were interrupted by fresh
negotiations for peace. Half a year had the flames of war been desolating
the fairest parts of France; yet the court was no nearer the attainment
of its ends than at the outbreak of hostilities. If the Roman Catholic
forces had been swollen to about forty thousand men, they were confronted
by a Huguenot army of twenty-eight or thirty thousand men in the very
neighborhood of the capital. The voice of prudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> dictated an immediate
settlement of the dispute before more lives were sacrificed, more towns
and villages destroyed, more treasure squandered. Catharine, reigning
supreme under her son's name, with her usual inconstancy of purpose, was
ready to exchange the war, into which she had plunged France by lending
too willing an ear to the suggestions of Philip of Spain, as they came to
her through the Cardinal of Lorraine and others, and which had produced
only bloodshed, devastation of the kingdom, and deeper depression of the
finances, for the peace to which Michel de l'Hospital, her better genius,
was constantly urging her by every consideration of policy and justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chancellor Michel de l'Hospital's memorial.</div>

<p>In a paper, wherein about this time the chancellor committed to writing
the arguments he had often ineffectually employed to persuade the king
and his mother, he combats with patriotic indignation the flimsy pretexts
of which the priests and the Spaniard made use in pressing the
continuance of hostilities. "'The king has more men than the Huguenots.'
True, but we find twice as many battles on record gained by the smaller
as by the greater number; in consequence of which fact all princes and
nations have recognized the truth that victory is the gift of God. 'The
king's cause is the more just.' Grant it&mdash;yet God makes use of such
instruments as He wills to punish our iniquities&mdash;the Babylonians, for
instance, of old, the Turks in our own days. The Huguenots have thus far
succeeded beyond all expectation. They have little money, but what they
have they use well, and they can get more. Their devotion to their cause
is conspicuous. They are not a rabble hastily gotten together, which has
risen imprudently, in disorder, without a leader, without discipline.
They are experienced, resolute, desperate warriors, with plans formed
long ago&mdash;men ready to risk everything for the attainment of their
matured designs. Necessity and despair render them docile and wonderfully
subject to discipline; and with this cooperates the high esteem they have
conceived of their leaders, whose ambition is restrained, whose union is
cemented by the same necessity which the ancients called 'the bond of
concord.' On the contrary, the king's camp is rent by quarrels, envy, and
rivalry; ambition is unbridled, avarice reigns supreme. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> the
termination of so wretched a war, there will shine forth a joyous and
blessed peace, which I can justly term a 'precious conquest,' since it
will render his Majesty redoubtable to all Europe, which has learned the
greatness of the two powers which the king will restore to his own
subjection.</p>

<p>"The true method of breaking up the leagues of the Huguenots is to remove
the necessity for forming them. This must be done by treating the
Huguenots no longer as enemies, but as friends. For, if we examine
carefully into the matter, we shall find that hitherto they have been
dealt with as rebels; and this has compelled them to resort to all means
of self-preservation. This has placed arms in their hands; this has
engendered the horrible desolation of France. For the intrigues set on
foot against them in all quarters were conducted with so little attempt
at secrecy&mdash;the disfavor was so evident, the disdain was so apparent, the
threats of the rupture of the Edict of Pacification and of the
publication of the decrees of the Council of Trent were so open, and the
injustice of their handling was so manifest, that they had been too dull
and stupid, had they not avoided the treachery in store for them.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
Even brute beasts perceive the coming of the storm, and seek the covert;
let us not find fault if men, perceiving it, arm themselves for the

preparatives; let us, therefore, cease to wonder that they stand ready to

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Edict of Pacification, Longjumeau, March 23, 1568.</div>

<p>L'Hospital was right. The Huguenots wanted nothing but security of person
and conscience&mdash;the latter even more than the former. And they were ready
to lay down their arms so soon as the court could bring itself to concede
the restoration of the Edict of Amboise, without the restrictive
ordinances and interpretations which had shorn it of most of its value.
On this basis negotiations now recommenced. The more prudent Huguenots
suggested that the party ought to receive at the king's hands some of the
cities in their possession, to be held as pledges for the execution of
the articles of the compact. But Charles and his counsellors resented the
proposal as insulting to the dignity of the crown,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and the
Huguenots, not yet fully appreciating the fickleness or treachery of the
court, did not press the demand&mdash;a fatal weakness, soon to be atoned for
by the speedy renewal of the war on the part of the Roman Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
After brief consultation the terms of peace were agreed upon, and were
incorporated in the royal edict of the twenty-third of March, 1568,
known, from the name of the place where it was signed, as the "Edict of
Longjumeau." The cardinal provisions were few: they re-established the
supremacy of the Edict of Amboise, expressly repealing all the
interpretations that infringed upon it; and permitted the nobles, who
under that law had been allowed to have religious exercises in their
castles, to admit strangers as well as their own vassals to the services
of the reformed worship. Condé and his followers were, at the same time,
recognized as good and faithful servants of the crown, and a general
amnesty was pronounced covering all acts of hostility, levy of troops,
coining of money, and similar offences. On the other hand, the Huguenots
bound themselves to disband and lay down their arms, to surrender the
places they held, to renounce foreign alliances, and to eschew in future
all meetings other than those religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> gatherings permitted under the
last peace. The new edict was not a final and irrevocable law, but was
granted "until, by God's grace, all the king's subjects should be
reunited in the profession of one and the same religion."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé favors and Coligny opposes the peace.</div>

<p>The Huguenots gained by this peace all their immediate demands, and so
far the edict might be deemed satisfactory. But what better security had
they for its observance more than they had had for the observance of that
which had preceded it? Coligny, prudent and far-sighted, had shown
himself as averse to concluding it without sufficient guarantees for its
faithful execution, as he had been opposed to beginning the war a
half-year before. The peace, he urged, was intended by the court only as
a means of saving Chartres, and of afterward overwhelming the
reformers;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and he attempted to prove his assertions by the signal
instances of bad faith which had provoked the recourse to arms. But Condé
was impatient. If we may believe Agrippa d'Aubigné, his old love of
pleasure was not without its influence;<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> but he covered his true
motives under the specious pretext afforded him by the Huguenot nobles,
who, fatigued with the incessant toils of the campaign, reduced to
straits by a warfare which they had carried on at their own expense, and
longing to revisit homes which had been repeatedly threatened with
desolation, had abandoned their standards and scattered to their
respective provinces at the first mention of peace.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> François de la

by volunteers who had come of their own accord and had served for six
months without pay, expect to accomplish?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the court sincere?</div>

<div class="sidenote">A treacherous plot detected. The king indignant.</div>

<p>Was the peace of Longjumeau&mdash;"the patched-up peace," or "the short
peace," as it was called; that "wicked little peace," as La Noue styles
it<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>&mdash;a compact treacherously entered into by the court? This is the
old, but constantly recurring question respecting every principal event
of this unhappy period; and it is one that rarely admits of an easy or a
simple answer. So far as the persons who had been chiefly instrumental in
forwarding the negotiations which ended in the peace of Longjumeau were
concerned, they were Chancellor L'Hospital and the Bishops of Orleans and
Limoges&mdash;the most moderate members of the royal council,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> whose fair
spirit was so conspicuous that for years they had been exposed to insult
and open hostility as supposed Huguenots. Nothing is clearer than that
the purpose of these men was the sincere and entire re-establishment of
peace on a lasting foundation. The arguments of L'Hospital which I have
laid before the reader furnish sufficient proof. This party had, through
the force of circumstances, temporarily obtained the ascendancy in the
council, and now had the ear of the queen mother. But there were by the
side of its representatives at the council-board men of an entirely
different stamp&mdash;advocates of persecution, of extermination; a few, from
conscientious motives, preferring, with Alva, a kingdom ruined in the
attempt to root out heresy, to one flourishing, with heresy tolerated; a
larger number&mdash;and Cardinal Lorraine, who had now resumed his seat and
his influence, must be classed with these&mdash;counting upon deriving
personal advantage from the supremacy of the papal faction. It is equally
manifest that this party could have acquiesced in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> peace, which again
formally acknowledged the principle of religious toleration, only with
the design of embracing the first favorable opportunity for crushing the
Huguenots, when scattered and disarmed. Their desires, at least, deceived
no one of ordinary perspicacity. Indeed, the peace came near failing to
go into effect at all, in consequence of the discovery of the fact that a
"privy council" had been held in the Louvre, to which none but sworn
enemies of the Huguenots were admitted, "wherein was conspired a surprise
of Orleans, Soissons, Rochelle, and Auxerre," to be executed by four
designated leaders, while the Protestants were laying down their arms. In
an age of salaried spies, it is not astonishing that by ten o'clock the
next morning the whole plot was betrayed to Cardinal Châtillon, who
immediately sent word to stay the publication of the peace. When Charles
heard of it, we are told that he swore, by the faith of a prince, that,
if there had been any such conspiracy, it had been formed wholly without
his knowledge, and, laying his hand on his breast, said: "This is the
cardinal and Gascoigne's practice. In spite of them, I will proceed with
the peace;" and, commanding pen and ink to be brought, he wrote Condé a
letter promising a good and sincere observance of the articles agreed
upon.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Short-sightedness of Catharine.</div>

<p>But, besides the two parties, and wavering between them&mdash;fluctuating in
her own purposes, as false to her own plans as she was to her promises,
with no principles either of morality or of government, intent only on
grasping power, the enemy of every one that stood in the way of this,
even if it were her son or her daughter&mdash;was that enigma, Catharine de'
Medici, whose secret has escaped so many simply because they looked for
something deep and recondite, when the solution lay almost upon the very
surface. Was Catharine sincerely in favor of peace? She was never
sincere. Her Macchiavellian training, the enforced hypocrisy of her
married life, the trimming policy she had thought herself compelled to
pursue during the minority of the kings, her two sons, had eaten from her
soul, even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> its root, truthfulness&mdash;that pure plant of heaven's
sowing. Loving peace only because it freed her from the fears, the
embarrassments, the vexations of war&mdash;not because she valued human life
or human happiness&mdash;she embraced it as a welcome expedient to enable her
to escape the present perplexities of her position. It is improbable that
Catharine distinctly premeditated a treacherous blow at the Huguenots,
simply because she rarely premeditated anything very long. I am aware
that this estimate of the queen is quite at variance with the views which
have obtained the widest currency; but it is the estimate which history,
carefully read, seems to require us to adopt. Catharine's plans were
proverbially narrow in their scope, never extending much beyond the
immediate present. After the catastrophe, which had perhaps been the
result of the impulse of the moment, she was not, however, unwilling to
accept the homage of those who deemed it a high compliment to her
prudence to praise her consummate dissimulation. She probably entered
upon the peace of Longjumeau without any settled purpose of
treachery&mdash;unless that state of the soul be in itself treachery that has
no fixed intention of upright dealing. But she had not, in adopting the
advice of Chancellor de l'Hospital, renounced the policy of the Cardinal
of Lorraine, in case that policy should at some future time appear to be
advantageous; and it was much to be feared that the contingency referred
to would soon arrive. Catharine, not less than Charles himself, resented
"the affair of Meaux" of the preceding September. It was studiously held
up to their eyes by the enemies of the Huguenots as an attempt upon the
honor, and indeed even upon the personal liberty and life of their
Majesties. Might not Catharine and Charles be tempted to retaliate by
trying the effect of a surprise upon the Huguenots themselves?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imprudence of the Huguenots.</div>

<p>The Huguenots had certainly been grossly imprudent in putting themselves
at the mercy of a woman whom they had greatly offended, and whose natural
place, according to those mysterious sympathies which bind men of similar
natures, was with their adversaries. They had been warned by their secret
friends at court, some of them by Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> Catholic relatives.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> But the
caution was little heeded. It was not long<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> before those who had been
the most strenuous advocates of peace began to admit that the draught
they had put to their own lips, and now must needs drink, was likely to
prove little to their taste.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Judicial murder of Rapin, at Toulouse.</div>

<p>The parliaments made serious objections to the reception of the edict.
Toulouse was, as usual, pre-eminent for its intolerance. The king sent
Rapin, a Protestant gentleman who had served with distinction under Condé
in Languedoc, to carry the law to the parliament, and require its
official recognition. The choice was unfortunate, for it awakened all the
hatred of a court proverbial for its hostility to the Reformation. An
accusation of matters quite foreign to his mission was trumped up against
Rapin, and, contrary to all the principles of justice, and
notwithstanding the privileged character he bore as the king's envoy, he
was arrested, condemned to death, and executed. So atrocious a crime
might perhaps have been punished, had not the new commotions to which we
shall soon be obliged to pay attention, intervened and screened the
culprits from their righteous retribution.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> content with
murdering Rapin, the Parliament of Toulouse still refused to register the
edict, and not less than four successive orders were sent by the king
before his refractory judges yielded an unwilling consent, even then
annexing restrictive clauses which they took care to insert in their
secret records.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seditious preachers and mobs.</div>

<p>Again Roman Catholic pulpits resounded, as they did whenever any degree
of toleration was accorded the Protestants, with denunciations of
Catharine, of Charles, of all in the council who had advocated such
pernicious views. Again Ahab and Jezebel appear; but while Catharine is
always Jezebel, it is Charles that now figures, in place of poor Antoine
of Navarre, as Ahab.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Again, in the struggle of royalty with priests

large as to command respect, the Protestants scarcely dared to return to
their homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Riot when the edict is published at Rouen.</div>

<p>The very mention of the peace, with its favorable terms for the
Protestants, was enough to stir up the anger of the ignorant populace.
When the Parliament of Rouen, after agreeing to the Edict of Longjumeau
in private session, threw open its doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> (on the third of April, 1568)
to give it official publication, a rabble that had come purposely to
create a tumult, interrupted the reading with horrible imprecations
against the peace, the Huguenots, the edicts, the "prêches," and the
magistrates who approved such impious acts. The presidents and
counsellors fled for their lives. The populace, as though inspired by
some evil spirit, raged and committed havoc in the "palais de justice."
The mob opened the prisons and liberated eight or ten Roman Catholics;
then flocked to the ecclesiastical dungeons and would have massacred the
Protestants that were still confined there, had these not found means to
ransom their lives with money. It was not until six days later that the
royal edict was read, in the presence of a large military force called in
to preserve order.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment of the returning Huguenots.</div>

<p>In spite of the provisions of the edict, the Huguenots wandered about in
the open country, avoiding the cities where they were likely to meet with
insult and violence, if not death. The Protestants of Nogent, Provins,
and Bray hesitated for three months, and then we are told that each man
watched his opportunity and sought to enter when his Roman Catholic
friends might be on guard to defend him from the insolence of others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Provins.</div>

<p>But the sufferings of the Huguenot burgess were not ended when he was
once more in his own house. He was studiously treated as a rebel. Every
movement was suspicious. A Roman Catholic chronicler, who has preserved
in his voluminous diary many of the details that enable us to restore
something of its original coloring to the picture of the social and
political condition of the times, vividly portrays the misfortunes of the
unfortunate Huguenots of Provins. They were not numerous. One by one,
thirty or forty had stealthily crept into town, experiencing no other
injury than the coarse raillery of their former neighbors. Thereupon the
municipal government met and deliberated upon the measures of police to
be taken "in order to hold the Huguenots in check and in fear, and to
avoid any treachery they might intend to put into prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>tice by the
introduction of their brother Huguenots into the city to plunder and hold
it by force." The determination arrived at was that each of the four
captains should visit the Huguenot houses of his quarter, examine the
inmates, and take all the weapons he found, giving a receipt to their
owners. This was not the only humiliation to which the Protestants were
subjected. A proclamation was published forbidding them from receiving
any person into their houses, from meeting together under any pretext,
from leaving their houses in the evening after seven o'clock in summer,
or five in winter, from walking by day or night on the walls, or, indeed,
from approaching within two arquebuse shots' distance of them&mdash;all upon
pain of death! They could not even go into the country without a passport
from the bailiff and the captain of the gate, the penalty of
transgressing this regulation being banishment. No wonder that the
Huguenots were irritated, and that most of them wished that they had not
returned.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Since, however, a royal ordinance of the nineteenth of May
expressly enjoined upon all fugitive Huguenots to re-enter the cities to
which they belonged, and in case of refusal commanded the magistrates to
raise a force and attack them as presumptive robbers and enemies of the
public peace,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> they were perhaps quite as safe within the walls as
roaming about outside of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expedition and fate of De Cocqueville.</div>

<p>Early in the summer an event occurred on the northern frontier, which,
although in itself of little weight, augmented the suspicions which the
Protestants began to entertain of the Spanish tendencies of the
government. One Seigneur de Cocqueville, with a party of French and
Flemish Huguenots, had crossed the northern boundary and invaded Philip's
Netherland provinces. He had, however, been driven back into France. As
he was believed to have acted under Condé's instructions, that prince was
requested by Charles to inform him whether Cocqueville were in his
service. When Condé disavowed him, and declined all responsibility for
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> movement, Marshal Cossé was directed to march against Cocqueville,
and, on the eighteenth of July, the Huguenot chieftain was captured at
the town of Saint Valéry, in Picardy, where he had taken refuge. Of
twenty-five hundred followers, barely three hundred are said to have been
spared. In order to please Alva, the Flemings received no quarter. The
leaders, Cocqueville, Vaillant, and Saint Amand, were brought to Paris
and gibbeted on the Place de Grève.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude of the government suspicious.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Garrisons and interpretative ordinances.</div>

<p>The central government itself gave the gravest grounds for fear and
suspicion. The Huguenots had promptly disbanded. They had lost no time in
dismissing their German allies, who, retiring with well-filled pockets to
the other side of the Rhine, seemed alone to have profited by the
intestine commotions of France.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> On the contrary, the Roman Catholic
forces showed no disposition to disarm. It is true that, in the first
fervor of the ascendancy of the peace party, Catharine countermanded a
levy of five thousand Saxons, much to the annoyance of Castelnau, who had
by his unwearied diligence brought them in hot haste to Réthel on the
Aisne, only to learn that the preliminaries of peace were on the point of
being concluded, and that the troopers were expected to retrace their
steps to Saxony.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> But the Swiss and Italian soldiers, as well as the
French gens-d'armes, were for the most part retained. To Humières, who
commanded for the king in Péronne, Charles wrote an explanation of his
course: "Inasmuch as there are sometimes turbulent spirits so constituted
that they neither can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> nor desire to accommodate themselves so soon to
quiet, it has appeared to me extremely necessary to anticipate this
difficulty, and act in such a manner that, force and authority remaining
on my side, I may be able to keep in check those who might so far forget
themselves as to set on foot new disturbances and be the cause of
seditious uprising."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Large garrisons were thus provided for those
towns which had rendered themselves conspicuous in the defence of the
Huguenots during the late war, and the sufferings of the Protestants,
upon whom, in preference to their Roman Catholic neighbors, the insolent
soldiers were quartered, were terrible beyond description.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The
horrors of the "dragonnades" of the reign of Louis the Fourteenth were
rivalled by these earlier military persecutions. Multitudes were
despoiled of their goods, hundreds lost their lives at the hands of their
cruel guests. France assumed the aspect of a great camp, with sentries
posted everywhere to maintain it in peace against some suspected foe. The
sea-ports, the bridges, the roads were guarded; the Huguenots themselves
were placed under a species of surveillance. Nor were the old resorts of
the court forgotten. Again interpretative ordinances were called in to
abrogate a portion of the law itself. Charles declared in a new
proclamation that he had not intended by the Edict of Longjumeau to
include Auvergne, nor any district belonging as an appanage to his
mother, to Anjou, Alençon, or the Bourbon princes, in the toleration
guaranteed by the edict. And thus a very considerable number of
Protestants were by a single stroke of the pen stripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> of the
privileges solemnly accorded to them but a few weeks before.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Other
pledges were as shamelessly broken. The Huguenot gentlemen whom the court
had attempted to punish by declaring them to have forfeited their honors
and dignities, were not reinstated according to the terms of the
edict.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Oppression by royal governors.</div>

<p>The conduct of individual governors furnished still greater occasion for
complaint and alarm. The Duke of Nemours, who, in marrying Anne of Este,
Guise's widow, two years before, seemed also to have espoused all the
hatred which the Lorraines felt for Protestantism, and for the family of
the Châtillons, its most prominent and faithful defenders, was governor
of the provinces of Lyonnais and Dauphiny. This insubordinate nobleman
loudly proclaimed his intention to disregard the Edict of Longjumeau, as
opposed to the Roman Catholic Church and to the king's honor. In vain did
the Protestants, who were numerous in the city of Lyons, demand to be
allowed to enjoy the two places of worship they had possessed, before the
late troubles, within the city walls. The duke would not listen to their
just claims, and the court, in answer to their appeals, only responded
that the king did not approve of the holding of Protestant services
inside of cities, and that a place would shortly be assigned for their
use in the vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Unrebuked by the queen or her son for his
flagrant disobedience, Nemours received nothing but plaudits from the
fanatical adherents of the religion he pretended to maintain, and was
honored by the Pope, Pius the Fifth (on the fifth of July, 1568), with a
special brief, in which he was praised for being the first to set a
resplendent example of resistance to the execution of an unchristian
peace.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Marshal Tavannes, in Burgundy, earned equal gratitude for his opposition
to the concession of Protestant rights. Not content with remonstrance
respecting a peace which had excited every one "to raise his voice
against the king and Catharine," and with dark hints of the danger of
handling so carelessly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> border province like Burgundy,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> he openly
favored the revival of those "Confraternities of the Holy Ghost" which
Charles had so lately condemned and prohibited. Being himself detained by
illness, two of his sons were present at a meeting of one of these
seditious assemblages, held in Dijon, the provincial capital, where,
before a great concourse of people, the most inflammatory language was
freely uttered.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Christian and Royal League."</div>

<div class="sidenote">Insubordination to royal authority.</div>

<p>At Troyes, the capital of Champagne, a similar association assumed the
designation of "the Christian and Royal League." The document, containing
the oath taken by the clergy whom the king's lieutenant had associated
with the nobility and the provincial estates in the "holy" bond, is still
extant, with the signatures of the bishop, the deans, canons, and
inferior ecclesiastics appended.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The primary object was the
maintenance of "the true Catholic and Roman Church of God;" and after
this the preservation of the crown for the house of Valois was mentioned.
It was to be sustained "against all persons, without excepting any, save
the persons of the king, his sons and brothers, and the queen their
mother, and without regard to any relationship or alliance," and "so long
as it might please God that the signers should be governed according to
the Roman and Apostolic Church."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> In less public utterances the
spirit of insubordination to the regal authority made itself understood
even more clearly. When the formation of such associations was objected
to, on the ground of the king's prohibition, the response given by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
who pretended to be better informed than the rest was that the Cardinal
of Lorraine could make the matter agreeable to his Majesty. Others more
boldly announced the intention of the Roman Catholic party, in case
Charles should refuse to sanction its course, to send him to a monastery
for the rest of his days, and elect another king in his place. Three
months' time was all that these blatant boasters allowed for the utter
destruction of the Huguenots in France. An end would be made of them as
soon as the harvest and vintage were past.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Admirable organization of the Huguenots.</div>

<p>If the Roman Catholics had resolved upon a renewal of the war, they
certainly had reason to desire a better combination of their forces than
they had effected in the late contest. They had been startled and amazed
at the rapidity with which, although embracing but an inconsiderable
minority of the population, the Huguenots had succeeded in massing an
army that held at bay that of the king. They admired the completeness of
the organization which enabled the Prince of Condé and the admiral to
summon the gentry of the most distant provinces, and bring them to the
very vicinity of the court before the movement was suspected even by
Constable Montmorency, who believed himself to be kept advised of the
most trifling occurrences that took place in any part of France. The
triumph of the Huguenots&mdash;for was it not a triumph which they had
achieved in securing such terms as the Edict of Longjumeau conceded?&mdash;was
a disgrace to the papists, who had not known how to use their
overwhelming preponderance in numbers. Never had a more signal example
been given of the superiority of united and zealous sympathy over
discordant and soulless counsels.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> While their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> enemies, with nothing
in common but their hatred of Protestantism, were hampered by the want of
concert between their leaders, or cheated of their success by their
positive jealousies and quarrels, the Huguenots had in their common
faith, in their well-ordered form of church government, combining the
advantages of great local efficiency with those of a representative
union, and in their common danger, the instruments best adapted to secure
the ends they desired. "They were so closely bound together by this order
and by these objects," wrote the Venetian ambassador Correro, "that there
resulted a concordant will and so perfect a union that it made them
prompt in rendering instant obedience and in forming common designs, and
most ready to execute the commands of their superiors."<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder runs riot throughout France.</div>

<p>With such associations as "the Confraternities of the Holy Ghost," and
"the Christian and Royal League" springing up in various parts of France,
under the express sanction of the provincial governors, and publishing as
their chief aim the extirpation of heresy from the realm; with priests
and monks, especially those of the new order of Jesus, inflaming the
passions of the people by seditious preaching, and persuading their
hearers that any toleration of heretics was a compact with Satan, it is
not strange that murder held high carnival wherever the Protestants were
not so numerous as to be able to stand on the defensive. The victims were
of every rank and station, from the obscure peasant to the distinguished
Cipierre, son of the Count de Tende and a relative of the Duke of Savoy,
the orders for whose assassination were confidently believed to have
issued from the court.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> At Auxerre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> which had been given up by the
Huguenots in accordance with the provisions of the peace, one hundred and
fifty Protestants paid with their lives the price of their good faith.
Their bodies were thrown into the public sewers. In the city of Amiens
one hundred and fifty persons were slaughtered at one time. Instead of
punishment, the rioters obtained their object: the reformed worship was
forbidden in Amiens, or within three leagues of the city.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> At
Clermont the assassins, after plundering the wares of a wealthy merchant,
who had refused to hang tapestry before his house at the time of the
procession on Corpus Christi Day&mdash;La Fête-Dieu&mdash;buried him in a fire made
of furniture taken from his own house.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> At Ligny, in Champagne, a
Huguenot was pursued into the very bedchamber of a royal officer, and
there killed. Troyes, Bourges, Rouen, and a host of other places,
witnessed the commission of atrocities which it would be rather sickening
than profitable to narrate.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> In Paris itself the murders of Huguenots
were frequent. "On Sunday last," wrote Norris, the English envoy, to his
royal mistress, "the Prince of Condé sent a gentleman to the king, to
beseech his Majesty to administer justice against such as murder them of
the religion, and as he entered into the city there were five slain in
St. Anthony's street, not far from my lodging."<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> The aggregate of
homicides committed within the brief compass of this so-called peace was
enormous. Jean de Serres and Agrippa d'Aubigné may possibly go somewhat
beyond the mark when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> they state the number of victims in three

<div class="sidenote">Rochelle and other cities refuse to receive garrisons.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Condé and Coligny retire.</div>

<div class="sidenote">D'Andelot's remonstrance.</div>

<p>While the majority of the cities held by the Protestants had, as we have
seen, promptly opened their gates to the king, a number, perceiving the
dangers to which they were exposed, alarmed by the attitude of the Roman
Catholics, and doubtful of the good faith of the court, declined to allow
the garrisons to enter. This was the case with La Rochelle, which
defended its course by appealing to its privileges, and with Montauban,
Albi, Milhau, Sancerre, Castres, Vézelay, and other less important
towns.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> The events of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> weeks had amply vindicated the wisdom
and justice of their refusal. La Rochelle even began to repair its
fortifications, confident that the papal faction would never rest until
it had made the attempt to destroy the great Huguenot stronghold in the
west. Evidently there was no safety for a Protestant under the ægis of
the Edict of Longjumeau. The Prince of Condé dared not resume the
government of the province nominally restored to his charge, and retired
to Noyers, a small town in Burgundy, belonging to his wife's dower, where
he would be less exposed than in the vicinity of Paris to any treacherous
attempt upon his person. Admiral Coligny was not slow in following his
example. He abandoned his stately manor of Châtillon-sur-Loing, where,
with a heart saddened by recent domestic affliction,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> he had been
compelled to exercise a princely hospitality to the crowds that daily
thronged to consult with him and to do him honor,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> up his
abode in the castle of Tanlay, belonging to his brother D'Andelot, and
within a few miles of the prince's retreat.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> D'Andelot himself had
recently started for Brittany, where his first wife, Claude de Rieux, had
held extensive possessions.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Before leaving, however, he had written
to Catharine de' Medici, a letter of remonstrance full of noble
sentiments. The occasion was the murder of one of his gentlemen, whom he
had sent to the neighboring city of Auxerre; but his letter embraced a
complete view of "the calamitous state of the poor kingdom," whose misery
"was such as to cause the hair of all that heard to stand on end." "Not
only," said D'Andelot, "can we feel no doubt that God will not leave
unpunished so much innocent blood, which continues to cry before Him for
vengeance, as well as so many violations of women and maidens; so many
robberies; so much oppression&mdash;in one word, every species of iniquity.
But, besides this, we can look for nothing else than the near-approaching
desolation and ruin of this state: for no one that has read sacred and
profane history will be able to deny that such things have always
preceded the overthrow of empires and monarchies. I am well aware,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
madam, that there will be those who, on seeing this letter, will ridicule
me, and will say that I am playing the part of prophet or preacher. I am
neither the one nor the other, since God has not given me this calling.
But I will yet say, with truth, that there is not a man in the kingdom,
of any rank or quality, who loves his king and his kingdom better than I
do, or who is more grieved at seeing those disorders that I see, which
can, in the end, result only in general confusion. I know full well that
I shall be met with the taking up of arms, in which I participated, with
so many others, on the eve of last St. Michael's Day, as if we had
intended to attack the persons of your Majesties, or anything belonging
to you, or this state, as was published wherever it was possible, and as
is still daily asserted. But, not to undertake other justification, I
will only say that, if such wickedness had entered into my heart, though
I might conceal it from men, I could not hide it from God, from whom I
never have asked forgiveness for it, nor ever shall I." D'Andelot
proceeded to show that the movement in question had been caused by
absolute necessity, and that this was rendered evident to all men by that
which was now occurring in every part of France. He told her that it was
sufficiently manifest that this universal oppression was only designed to
provoke "those of the religion" to such a point that they would lose
patience, and to obtain a pretext for attacking and exterminating them.
He reminded her that he had often insisted "that opinions in matters of
religion can be changed neither by fire nor by force of arms, and that
those deem themselves very happy who can lay down their lives for the
service of God and for His glory." He warned her of those who, unlike the
Huguenots, would sacrifice the interests of the state to their own
individual ends of ambition or revenge. In conclusion, after alluding to
a recent sudden death which much resembled a mark of the divine
displeasure upon the murderous assault that had called forth this letter,
he exclaimed: "I do not mean to be so presumptuous as to judge the
dealings of God; but I do mean to say, with the sure testimony of His
word, that all those who violate public faith are punished for it."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>That salutary warning had been rung in Catharine's ears more than once,
and was destined to be repeated again and again, with little effect: "All
those who violate public faith are punished for it." L'Hospital had but a
few months before been urging to a course of political integrity, and
pointing out the rock on which all previous plans of pacification had
split. There was but one way to secure the advantages of permanent peace,
and that was an upright observance of the treaties formed with the
Huguenots. But Catharine was slow to learn the lesson. Crooked paths, to
her distorted vision, seemed to be the shortest way to success. Her
Italian education had taught her that deceit was better, under all
circumstances, than plain dealing, and she could not unlearn the
long-cherished theory. Whether L'Hospital's views were originally the
chief motives that influenced her in consenting to the peace of
Longjumeau, or whether she had acquiesced in it as a cover to treacherous
designs, certain it is that she now began to side openly with the
chancellor's enemies, and that the Cardinal of Lorraine regained his old
influence in the council. The fanatical sermons that had been a
premonitory symptom of the previous wars were again heard with
complacency in the court chapel; for, about the month of June, the king
appointed as his preachers four of the most blatant advocates of
persecution: Vigor, a canon of Notre Dame; De Sainte Foy; the gray friar,
Hugonis; and Claude de Sainctes, whose acquaintance the reformers had
made at the Colloquy of Poissy.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Remonstrance of the three marshals.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's intrigues.</div>

<p>There had been a desperate struggle in the royal council ever since the
conclusion of the peace. The extreme Roman Catholics, recognizing the
instability of Catharine, had long since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> begun to base their hopes upon
Henry of Anjou's influence. Their opponents accepted the issue, and
resolved to circumscribe the duke's inordinate powers. Three of the
marshals of France&mdash;Montmorency, his brother Damville, and
Vieilleville&mdash;presented themselves at a meeting of the royal council held
in the queen mother's sick-chamber (on the second of May, 1568), to
remonstrate against Anjou's retaining the office of lieutenant-general.
Even Cardinal Bourbon supported their movement, and, sinking for the time
his extreme religious partisanship, threatened to leave the court, and
give the world to understand how much he had at heart the honor of his
house and the welfare of his friends. The object of the marshals could
not be mistaken: it was nothing less than the overthrow of the Cardinal
of Lorraine, who sought supreme power under cover of Anjou's name. The
end of the war, remarked the ambassador, Sir Henry Norris, had brought no
end to the mortal hatred between the houses of Guise and Montmorency. The
prospect of permanent peace was dark. The king was easy to be seduced,
his mother bent upon maintaining these divisions in the court, and Anjou
so much under the cardinal's influence that it was to be feared that the
Huguenots would in the end be forced to have recourse once more to arms.
In the midst of these perils, the queen mother had been exercising her
ingenuity in playing off one party against the other; now giving
countenance to the Guises, now to the Montmorencies. At one time she used
Limoges, at another Morvilliers or Sens, in her secret intrigues.
Presently she resorted to Lorraine, and, when jealous of his too great
forwardness, would turn to the chancellor himself, "undoing in one day
what the cardinal had intended long afore." Besides these prominent
statesmen, she had not scrupled to take up with meaner tools&mdash;men whose
elevation boded no good to the commonwealth, and with whom she conferred
about the imposition of those onerous taxes which had cost her the
forfeiture of the good-will of the people. To add to the confusion, the
jealousy between the king and his brother Anjou had reappeared, and the
chancellor had lost his characteristic courage and avowed his utter
despair of being able to stem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> the fierce tide of human selfishness and
passion. Cardinal Lorraine was realizing his long-cherished hope: "for
this one man's authority had been the greatest countermand of his
devices."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The court tries to ruin Condé and Coligny.</div>

<p>The Huguenot leaders had entered into engagements to repay to the king
the nine hundred thousand francs advanced by him to the German reiters of
Count Casimir. This sum&mdash;a large one for the times&mdash;Charles now called
upon Condé and Coligny to refund, and he expressly commanded that it
should not be levied upon the Protestant churches, but be raised by those
who had taken up arms in the late contest.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> It was a transparent
attempt to array the masses that had suffered little pecuniarily in the
war against the brave men who had not only impoverished themselves, but
hazarded their lives in defence of the common cause. Nothing less than
the financial ruin of the prince and the admiral, who had voluntarily
become sureties, seemed likely to satisfy their enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Téligny sent to carry a reply.</div>

<p>The Prince of Condé despatched young Téligny to carry his spirited reply
to this extraordinary demand, and, not confining himself to the
exhibition of its flagrant injustice, he recapitulated the daily
multiplying infractions upon the edict. The Protestants were treated as
enemies, he said, and were safe neither at home nor abroad. An open war
could not be more bitter.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Besides countless general massacres, he
complained of the recent assassination of two of his own dependants, and
of the surveillance exercised over all the great noblemen "of the
religion," who were closely watched in their castles by the commanders of
neighboring forces. Against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> himself the unparalleled insult had been
shown of placing a garrison in the palace of a prince of the blood. Nay,
he had arrested a spy caught in the very act of measuring the height of
the fortifications of Noyers, and sounding the depth of the moat, with a
view to a subsequent assault, and the capture not only of the prince, but
of the admiral, who frequently came there to see him. He rehearsed the
grounds of just alarm which the Protestants had in the threats their
indiscreet enemies were daily uttering, and in "the confraternities of
the Holy Ghost," defiantly instituted with the approval of the king's own
governors. What safety was there for the Huguenots when a counsellor of a
celebrated parliament had lately asserted, in the presence of an assembly
of three thousand persons, "that he had commands from the leading men of
the royal council admonishing the Catholics that they ought to give no
credence to any edicts of the king unless they contained a peculiar mark
of authenticity." And he was induced to believe him right, by noticing
the fact that, since the establishment of peace, no one had obeyed the
royal letters. Finally, in decided but respectful language, he
remonstrated against the pernicious precedent which the court was
allowing to become established, when the express commands of the monarch
were set at naught with impunity.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">An oath to be exacted of the Huguenots.</div>

<p>As the time approached for the blow to be struck that should forever put
an end to the exercise of the reformed faith in France, the conspirators
began to betray their anxiety lest their nefarious designs might be
anticipated and rendered futile by such a measure of defence as that
which the Huguenots had taken on the eve of Michaelmas. They resolved,
therefore, if possible, to bind their victims hand and foot; and no more
convenient method presented itself than that of involving them in
obligations of implicit obedience which would embarrass, if they did not
absolutely preclude, any exercise of their wonderful system of combined
action. About the beginning of August, Charles despatched to all parts of
his dominions the form of an oath which was to be demanded of every
Protestant subject, and the royal officers and magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> were directed
to make lists of those who signed as well as of those who refused to sign
it.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> "We protest before God, and swear by His name"&mdash;so ran the

express command, of which he may have notified us by his letters patent
duly verified; and that we will never consent to, nor assist with

themselves against him or his will. We will make no levy or assessment of
money for any purpose without his express commission; and will never
enter into any secret leagues, intrigues, or plots, nor engage in any

that we will not leave the city, whatever necessity may arrive, but will
join our hearts, our wills, and our abilities with our fellow-citizens in
defence of that city, to which we will always entertain the devotion of
true and faithful citizens, whilst the Catholics will find in us sincere
and fraternal affection: awaiting the time when it may please God to put
an end to all troubles, to which we hope that this reconciliation will be
a happy prelude."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>The trap was not ill contrived, and its bars were strong enough to hold
anything that might venture within. Fortunately, however, the bait did
not conceal the cruel design lurking behind it. Why, it might be asked,
this new test? Was Condé, whom the king had only four or five months ago
recognized by solemn edict as his "dear cousin and faithful servant and
subject," a friend or a foe? Had peace been concluded with the Hugue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>nots
only that they might anew be treated as rebels and enemies? What had
become of the prescribed amnesty? Was it at all likely that private
citizens would bury in oblivion their former dissensions and abstain from
mutual insults, when the monarch officially reminded them that there was
one class of his subjects whose past conduct made them objects of grave
suspicion? While, therefore, the Huguenots professed themselves ready to
give the king all possible assurances of their loyal devotion, they
declined to swear to a form that bore on its face the proof that it was
composed, not in accordance with Charles's own ideas, but by an enemy of
the crown and of public tranquillity. They requested that it might
receive such modifications as would permit them to sign it with due
regard to their own self-respect and to their religious convictions, and
they entreated Charles to confirm their liberty of conscience and of
religious observance; for, without these privileges, which they valued
above their own existence, they were ready to forsake, not only their
cities, but their very lives also.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The plot disclosed by an intercepted letter.</div>

<p>At this critical moment the destiny of France was wavering in the
balance, and the decision depended upon the answer to be given to the
question whether Chancellor L'Hospital or Cardinal Lorraine should retain
his place in the council. The tolerant policy of the former is too well
understood to need an explanation. The designs of the latter are revealed
by an intercepted letter that fell into the hands of the Huguenots about
this time. It was written (on the ninth of August) at the little
country-seat named Madrid,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> whose ruins are still pointed out, near
the banks of the Seine, on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne, and not far
from the walls of the city of Paris. The writer, evidently a devoted
partisan of the house of Guise, had been entrusted by the Cardinal of
Lorraine<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> with a glimpse at the designs of the party of which the
latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> was the declared chief. A proclamation was soon to be made in the
king's name, through Marshal Cossé, to the Protestant nobles, assuring
them of the monarch's intention to deal kindly and peaceably with them,
to preserve their religious liberties, and to treat them as his faithful
subjects; and explaining the design of the movement which he was now
setting on foot to be merely the reduction of the inhabitants of some
insolent cities (those that, like La Rochelle, had refused to admit
garrisons) to his authority. This announcement, the cardinal proceeded to
say, might disturb some good Catholics, who would think that their labors
and the dangers they had undergone were all in vain. In reality, however,
it was only intended to secure the power in the hands of the king, and to
take away from the Protestant leaders all occasion for assembling, until,
being reduced to straits, that rabble, so hostile to the king and the
kingdom, should be wholly destroyed. Thus the very remnants would be
annihilated; for the seed would assuredly spring up again, unless the
same course should be pursued as that of which the French had resplendent
examples shown them by their neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Meanwhile, until these plans
could be carried into effect, as they would doubtless be within the
present month, the Protestant nobles must be carefully diverted, as some
were already showing signs of security, and others of falling into the
snare prepared for them. The cardinal, so he informed the writer, was
confident, with God's favor, of an easy and most certain victory over the
enemies of the faith.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Isabella of France again her husband's mouthpiece.</div>

<p>Such were the cardinal's intentions as expressed by himself and reported
almost word for word<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> in a letter to which I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> presently have
occasion again to direct the reader's attention. It was the policy
advocated persistently both by Pius the Fifth and by Philip the Second,
and embodied in counsel which would have been resented by a court
possessed of more self-respect than the French court, as impertinent
advice. For, in the report made to Catharine by one of her servants at
the Spanish capital, there is a wonderful similarity in the language
employed to that used at the conference of Bayonne. Isabella of France is
again the speaker, though much suspected of uttering rather the
sentiments of Philip, her husband, who was present,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> than her own.
Again, after expressing the most vehement zeal for the welfare of her
native country, she advocated rigorous measures against the Huguenots, in
phrases almost identical with those which, as the Duke of Alva relates,
she had addressed to her mother three years before. "She told me among
other things," says the queen's agent, "that she would never believe that
either the king her brother, or you, will ever execute the design already
entered into between you (although, by your command, I had notified the
king [Philip] and herself of your good-will respecting this matter),
until she saw it performed; for you had often before made them the same
promises, but no result had ever followed. She feared that your Majesties
might be dissuaded from action by the smooth speeches of certain persons
in your court, until the enemy gained the opportunity of forming new
designs, not only against the king's authority, but even against
yourselves. The apprehension kept her in a constant state of alarm."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">King Charles entreats his mother to avoid war.</div>

<p>But, although Catharine had now given in her adhesion to the Spanish and
Lorraine party, the success of that party was as yet incomplete.
L'Hospital was still in the privy council, and Charles himself greatly
preferred the conciliation and peace ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>vocated by the chancellor. The
same letter from the pleasure-palace of "Madrid," on the banks of the
Seine, whose contents have already occupied our attention, makes
important disclosures respecting the attitude of the unhappy prince, of
whom it may be questioned whether his greatest misfortune was that he had
so unprincipled a mother, or that he had not sufficient strength of will
to resist her pernicious designs. "I observed," wrote this correspondent
still further in reference to the Cardinal of Lorraine, "that he was very
much excited on account of a conversation which the king had recently had
with the queen, and which he believed to have been suggested to him by
others. For the king entreated his mother, almost as a suppliant, 'to
take the greatest care lest war should again break out, and that the
edict should everywhere be observed: otherwise he foresaw the complete
ruin of his kingdom.'<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> And when the queen alleged the rebellion of
the inhabitants of La Rochelle, he replied, as he had been instructed
beforehand, 'that the Rochellois only desired to retain their ancient
privileges. Their demand was not unreasonable; and even if it were, it
was better to make a temporary sacrifice to the welfare of the realm than
to plunge in new turmoil. As to the nobles, he was persuaded that they
would live peaceably if the edict were properly executed. In short, he
was earnestly desirous that matters should be restored to their best and
most quiet state.' The queen and very many other illustrious persons have
but one object of fervent desire, and that is to see the kingdom of
France return to the condition it was in under Francis and Henry. The
queen mother knows that this speech was dictated to him by certain men,
and she owes the authors of it no good-will. So much the more anxiously
does she desire, in common with a vast multitude of good Catholics, to
prove to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> the king that whatever is done in this affair has for its sole
object to liberate him from servitude and make him a king in reality, and
to expel the pestilence and those infected by it&mdash;a result utterly
unattainable in any other way."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's animosity against L'Hospital.</div>

<p>Catharine could not doubt that it was Michel de l'Hospital that had
infused into Charles his own just and pacific spirit. From the moment she
had come to this conclusion the chancellor's fall was inevitable. The
particular occasion of it, however, seems to have been the opposition
which he offered to the reception of a papal bull. To relieve the royal
treasury, the court had applied to Rome for permission to alienate
ecclesiastical possessions in France yielding an income of fifty thousand
crowns (or one hundred and fifty thousand francs), on the plea that the
indebtedness had been incurred in defence of the Roman Catholic faith.
Pius the Fifth granted the application, but in his bull of the first of
August, 1568, he not only made it a condition that the funds should be
exclusively employed under the direction of a trustworthy person&mdash;and as
such he named the Cardinal of Lorraine&mdash;in the extermination of the
heretics of France, or their reconciliation with the Church of Rome, but
he ascribed to Charles in making the request the declared purpose of
continuing a work for which his own means had proved inadequate. The
reception of the document was in itself an act of bad faith, and the
chancellor resisted it to the utmost of his power, urging that the
pontiff should be requested to alter its objectionable form.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another quarrel between Lorraine and the chancellor.</div>

<p>Another of those painful scenes occurred in the privy council (on the
nineteenth of September), of which there had been so many within the past
four or five years. Again the disputants were the Cardinal of Lorraine
and the chancellor. The former angrily demanded the reason why L'Hospital
had refused to affix his signature to the bull; whereupon the latter
alleged, among many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> grounds, that to revoke the Edict of
Pacification, as demanded by the Pope, "was the direct way to cause open
wars, and to bring the Germans into the realm." The cardinal was "much
stirred." He called L'Hospital a hypocrite; he said that his wife and
daughter were Calvinists. "You are not the first of your race that has
deserved ill of the king," he added. "I am sprung from as honest a race
as you are," retorted the other. Beside himself with fury, Lorraine "gave
him the lie, and, rising incontinently out of his chair," would have
seized him by the beard, had not Marshal Montmorency stepped in between
them. "Madam," said the cardinal, "in great choler," turning to the queen
mother, in whose presence the angry discussion took place, "the
chancellor is the sole cause of all the troubles in France, and were he
in the hands of parliament his head would not tarry on his shoulders
twenty-four hours." "On the contrary, Madam," rejoined L'Hospital, "the
cardinal is the original cause of all the mischiefs that have chanced as
well to France, within these eight years, as to the rest of Christendom.
In proof of which I refer him to the common report of even those who most
favor him."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The chancellor's fall.</div>

<p>But the chancellor accomplished nothing. Catharine had overcome her weak
son's partiality for the grave old counsellor by persuading him that, as
the chancellor's wife, his daughter, his son-in-law, and indeed his
entire house, were avowedly Huguenots, it was impossible but that he was
himself only restrained from making an open profession of Protestantism
by the fear of losing his present position.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Finding himself not only
stripped of all influence, and compelled to witness the enactment of
measures repugnant to his very nature, but an object of hatred to his
associates, Michel de l'Hospital withdrew from a council board where, as
he asserted, even Charles himself did not dare to express his opinions
freely.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Subsequently retiring altogether from the court to his
country-seat of Vignai, not far from Étampes, he surrendered his
insig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>nia of office to a messenger of Catharine, who came to recommend
him, in the king's name, to take that rest which his advanced years
demanded. Monsieur de Morvilliers succeeded him, with the title of keeper
of the seals, but the full powers of chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> In quiet
retirement, the venerable judge and legislator lingered more than four
years, unhappy only in being spared to see the melancholy results of the
rejection of his prudent counsels, the desolation of his native land, and
the transformation of an amiable king into a murderer of his own
subjects. Few days in this eventful reign were more lasting in their
consequences than that which beheld the final removal from all direct
influence upon the court of the only leading politician or statesman who
could have forestalled the horrors of a generation of inhuman wars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The plot.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Marshal Tavannes its author.</div>

<p>The crisis now rapidly approached. The Huguenot chiefs were widely
separated from each other&mdash;Montgomery in Normandy, Genlis and Mouy in
Picardy, Rochefoucauld at Angoulême, D'Andelot in Brittany, Condé and
Coligny in Burgundy. The royal court, now entirely in the interest of the
Guises, resolved to execute the plan which the Roman Catholic nobles of
this faction had sketched to Alva three years before at Bayonne, by the
seizure of five or six of the leaders, as a measure preliminary to the
total suppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> of Protestantism in France. Gaspard de Tavannes was
entrusted with the execution of the most important part of the
scheme&mdash;the arrest of the prince and the admiral. Fourteen companies of
gens-d'armes and as many ensigns of infantry stood under his orders, and
Noyers was closely beset on all sides.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> It was at this moment, when
secrecy was all important to the success of the plot, that the tidings of
the threatening storm reached its destined victims. It has long been
believed and reported that Tavannes, unwilling to lend himself to
unworthy machinations whose execution would have wounded his soldierly
pride, took measures to warn Condé and Coligny of their danger.
Unfortunately, the story rests on no better authority than his
"Mémoires," written by a son who has often shown a greater desire to
vindicate his father's memory than to maintain historical truth, and who,
writing under the rule of the Bourbons, had in this case, as in that of
the pretended deliverance of Henry of Navarre and Henry of Condé, at the
great Parisian massacre four years later, sufficient inducements for
endeavoring to represent the reigning family as indebted to his father
for its preservation.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Brantôme is consistent with the entire mass of
contemporary documents in representing Tavannes as the author of the
whole scheme; and certainly one who was so deeply implicated in the
massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day cannot have been too humane to think of
capturing, or even assassinating, two nobles, although one of them was a
prince of the blood. A more probable story is that Tavannes was the
unintentional instrument of the disclosure, a letter of his having fallen
into Huguenot hands, containing the words: "The deer is in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> net; the
game is ready."<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> But, in point of fact, the Huguenots needed no such
hints. With their perfect organization, in the face of so treacherous a
foe, after so many violations as they had of late witnessed of the royal
edict, they were already on their guard, and the hostile preparations had
not escaped their notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé's last appeal to the king.</div>

<p>When the news first reached him that the troops sent ostensibly to
besiege La Rochelle were recalled, Condé, alarmed by what he heard from
every quarter, had begged his mother-in-law, the Marchioness de Rothelin,
to go to the court and entreat the king, in his name, to maintain the
sanctity of his engagements, confirmed by repeated oaths. Scarcely had
she departed, however, before he received fresh and reiterated warnings
that his safety depended upon instant escape. He determined,
nevertheless, to make a last attempt to avert the horrid prospect of a
war which, from the malignant hatred exhibited by all classes of Roman
Catholics, he rightly judged would exceed the previous contests both in
duration and in destructiveness. He addressed to his young sovereign a
letter explaining the necessity of the step he was about to take,
accompanied by a long appeal, of which it would be impracticable to give
even a brief summary. Every point in the multitudinous grievances of
which the Huguenots complained was recapitulated. Every counter-charge
with which the court had endeavored to parry the force of previous
remonstrances was satisfactorily answered. In eloquent terms the prince
indicted Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, as the enemy alike of the royal
dignity and of the liberties of the people, as the author of all the
troubles of France, and the advocate and defender of robbers and
murderers.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> He reminded the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> the declaration of Maximilian,
the present Emperor of Germany, in a letter written before his election
to Charles himself: "All the wars and all the dissensions that are to-day
rife among the Christians have originated from two cardinals&mdash;Granvelle
and Lorraine."<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> And he closed the long and eloquent document by
protesting, in the sight of God and of all foreign nations, that the
Huguenot nobles sought the punishment of Lorraine and his associates
alone, as the guilty causes of all the calamities that portended
destruction to the French crown, and would pursue them as perjured
violators of the public faith and capital enemies of peace and
tranquillity. He therefore hoped that no one would be astonished if he
and his allies should henceforth refuse to receive as the king's commands
anything that might be decided upon by the royal council, so long as the
cardinal might be present at its sessions, but should regard them as
fabrications of the cardinal and his fellows. The causes of the
misfortunes that might arise must be attributed, not to himself and his
Huguenot allies, but to the cardinal and his Roman Catholic
confederates.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The flight of the prince and the admiral.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Proves wonderfully successful.</div>

<p>Having despatched "this testimony of the innocence, integrity, and faith"
of himself and of his associates, "to be transmitted to posterity in
everlasting remembrance," the Prince of Condé set out on the same day
(the twenty-third of August) from Noyers. Coligny had joined him,
bringing from Tanlay his daughter, the future bride of Téligny&mdash;and,
after that nobleman's assassination on St. Bartholomew's Day, of William
of Orange, the hero of the revolt of the Netherlands&mdash;and his young sons,
as well as the wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> infant son of his brother D'Andelot. Condé was
himself accompanied by his wife, who was expecting soon to be confined,
and by several children. His own servants and those of the admiral, with
a few noblemen that came in from the neighborhood, swelled their escort
to about one hundred and fifty horse.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> With such a handful of men,
and embarrassed in their flight by the presence of those whom their age
or their sex disqualified for the endurance of the fatigues of a
protracted journey, Condé and Coligny undertook to reach the friendly
shelter of the walls of La Rochelle. It was a perilous attempt. The
journey was one of several hundred miles, through the very heart of
France. The cities were garrisoned by their enemies. The bridges and
fords were guarded. The difficulties, in fact, were apparently so
insurmountable, that the Roman Catholics seem to have expected that any
attempt to escape would be made in the direction of Germany, where
Casimir, their late ally, would doubtless welcome the Protestant leaders.
This mistake was the only circumstance in their favor, for it diminished
the number and the vigilance of the opposing troops.</p>

<p>The march was secret and prompt. Contrary to all expectation, an
unguarded ford was discovered not far from the city of Sancerre,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> by

numbers considerably increased by reinforcements by the way, entered the
gates of La Rochelle amid the acclamations of the brave inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The third civil war opens.</div>

<blockquote><div class="sidenote">The city of La Rochelle and its privileges.</div>

<p>The city of La Rochelle, said to have become a walled place
about 1126, had received many tokens of favor at the hands of
its successive masters before the accession of Queen Alienor,
or Éléonore, last Duchess of Aquitaine. It was by a charter of
this princess, in 1199, that the municipality, or "commune,"
was established. (Arcère, Hist. de la Rochelle, ii., Preuves,
660, 661.) The terms of the charter are vague; but, as
subsequently constituted, the "commune" consisted of one
hundred prominent citizens, designated as "pairs," or peers,
in whom all power was vested. The first member in dignity was
the "maire" or mayor, selected by the Seneschal of Saintonge
from the list of three candidates yearly nominated by his
fellow-members. The historian of the city compares him, for
power and for the sanctity attaching to his person, to the
ancient tribunes of Rome. Next were the twenty-four
"échevins," or aldermen, one-half of whom on alternate years
assisted the mayor in the administration of justice. Last of
all came seventy-five "pairs" having no separate designation,
who took part in the election of the mayor, and voted, on
important occasions, in the "assemblée générale." (See a
historical discussion, Arcère, i. 193-199.)</p>

<p>From King John Lackland, of England, the Rochellois are said
to have received express exemption from the duty of marching
elsewhere in the king's service, without their own consent,
and from admitting into their city any troops from abroad. (P.
S. Callot, La Rochelle protestante, 1863, p. 6.) When, in
1224, after standing a siege of three weeks, La Rochelle fell
into the hands of Louis VIII. of France, its new master
engaged to maintain all its privileges&mdash;a promise which was
well observed, for not only did the city lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> nothing, but it
actually received new favors at the king's hands. (Arcère, i.
212; Callot, 6.) In 1360, the disasters of the French,
consequent upon the battle of Poitiers, compelled the monarch
to surrender the city of La Rochelle to his captors in order
to regain his liberty. The concession was reluctantly made,
with the most flattering testimony to the past fidelity of the
inhabitants (see letters of John II. of France, to the
Rochellois, Calais, Oct., 1360, Arcère, ii, Preuves, 761), and
it was with still greater reluctance that the latter consented
to carry it into effect. "They made frequent excuses," says
Froissard, "and would not, for upwards of a year, suffer any
Englishman to enter their town. The letters were very
affecting which they wrote to the King of France, beseeching
him, by the love of God, that he would never liberate them of
their fidelity, nor separate them from his government and
place them in the hands of strangers; for they would prefer
being taxed every year one-half of what they were worth,
rather than be in the hands of the English." (Froissard, i. c.
214, Johnes's Trans.) When compelled to yield, it was with the
words: "We will honor and obey the English, but our hearts
shall never change." Edward the Third had solemnly confirmed
their privileges (Callot, 8).</p>

<p>But La Rochelle's unwilling subjection to the English crown
was of brief duration. By a plot, somewhat clumsily contrived,
but happily executed (Aug., 1372), the commander of the
garrison, who did not know how to read, was induced to lead
his troops outside of the castle wall for a review. The royal
order that had been shown him was no forgery, but had been
sent on a previous occasion, and the attesting seal was
genuine. At a preconcerted signal, two hundred Rochellois rose
from ambush, and cut off the return of the English. The
latter, finding their antagonists reinforced by two thousand
armed citizens under the lead of the mayor himself, soon came
to terms, and, withdrawing the few men they had left behind in
the castle, accepted the offer of safe transportation by a
ship to Bordeaux. (See the entertaining account in Froissard,
i. c. 311.) The wary Rochellois took good care, before even
admitting into their city Duguesclin, Constable of France,
with a paltry escort of two hundred men-at-arms, to stipulate
that pardon should be extended to those who immediately after
the departure of the English had razed the hateful castle to
the ground, and that no other should ever be erected; that La
Rochelle and the country dependent upon it should henceforth
form a particular domain under the immediate jurisdiction of
the king and his parliament of Paris; that its militia should
be employed only for the defence of the place; and that La
Rochelle should retain its mint and the right to coin both
"black and white money." (Froissard, <i>ubi supra</i>, corrected by
Arcère, i. 260.) Not only did the grateful monarch readily
make these concessions, and confirm all La Rochelle's past
privileges, but, for its "immense services," by a subsequent
order he conferred nobility upon the "mayor," "échevins" and
"conseillers" of the city, both present and future, as well as
upon their children forever. (Letters of January 8, 1372/3,
Arcère, ii., Preuves, 673-675.)</p>

<p>The extraordinary prerogatives of which this was the origin
were recognized and confirmed by subsequent monarchs,
especially by Louis the Eleventh, Charles the Eighth, Louis
the Twelfth, and Francis the First. (Callot, 11.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> The
resistance of the inhabitants to the exaction of the obnoxious
"gabelle," or tax upon salt, did indeed, toward the end of the
reign of the last-named king (1542), bring them temporarily
under his displeasure; but, with the exception of a
modification in their municipal government, made in 1530, and
revoked early in the reign of Henry the Second, the city
retained its quasi-independence without interruption until the
outbreak of the religious wars.</p>

<p>As we have seen (<i>ante</i>, p. 227), La Rochelle was in 1552 the
scene of the judicial murder of at least two Protestants. The
constancy of one of the sufferers had been the means of
converting many to the reformed doctrines, and among others
Claude d'Angliers, the presiding judge, whose name may still
be read at the foot of their sentence. (Arcère, i. 329.) So
rapidly had those doctrines spread, that on Sunday, May 31,
1562, the Lord's Supper was celebrated according to the
fashion of Geneva, not in one of the churches, but on the
great square of the hay-market, in a temporary enclosure shut
in on all sides by tapestries and covered with an awning of
canvas. More than eight thousand persons took part in the
exercises. But if the morning's services were remarkable, the
sequel was not less singular. "As the disease of
image-breaking was almost universal," says an old chronicler,
"it was communicated by contagion to the inhabitants of this
city, in such wise that, that very afternoon about three or
four o'clock, five hundred men, who were under arms and had
just received the same sacrament, went through all the
churches and dashed the images in pieces. Howbeit it was a
folly conducted with wisdom, seeing that this action passed
without any one being wounded or injured." (P. Vincent, <i>apud</i>
Callot, 34, and Delmas, 61.) As usual, the whole affair was
condemned by the ministers.</p>

<p>Although La Rochelle had steadily refused, during the earlier
part of the first religious war, to declare for the Prince of
Condé, and had maintained a kind of neutrality, the court was
in constant fear lest the weight of its sympathies should yet
draw it in that direction. It was therefore a matter of great
joy when, in October, 1562, the Duke of Montpensier succeeded,
by a ruse meriting the designation of treachery, in throwing
himself into La Rochelle with a large body of troops. With his
arrival the banished Roman Catholic mass returned, and the
Protestant ministers were warned to leave at once. (Arcère, i.
339.)</p>

<p>For two months after the restoration of peace, the Huguenots
of La Rochelle, embracing almost the entire population, held
their religious services, in accordance with the terms of the
Edict of Pacification, in the suburbs of the city. But, on the
9th of May, 1563, Charles the Ninth was prevailed to give
directions that one or two places should be assigned to the
Huguenots within the city. This gracious permission was
ratified with greater solemnity in letters patent of July
14th, in which the king declared the motive to be the
representations made to him of "the inconveniences and eminent
dangers that might arise in our said city of La Rochelle, if
the preaching and exercise of the pretended reformed religion
should continue to be held outside of the said city, being, as
it is, a frontier city in the direction of the English,
ancient enemies of the inhabitants of that city, where it
would be easy for them, by this means, to execute some evil
enterprise." (Commission of Charles IX., to M. de Jarnac. This
valuable MS., with other MSS., carried to Dublin at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes, by M. Elie Bouhereau, and
placed in the Marsh Library, has recently been restored to La
Rochelle, in accordance with M. Bouhereau's written
directions. Delmas, 369.)</p>

<p>Two years later, Charles and his court, returning from their
long progress through France, came to La Rochelle, and spent
three days there (Sept., 1565). A noteworthy incident occurred
at his entry. The jealous citizens had not forgotten an
immemorial custom which was not without significance. A silken
cord had been stretched across the road by which the monarch
was to enter, that he might stop and promise to respect the
liberties and franchises of La Rochelle. Constable Montmorency
was the first to notice the cord, and in some anger and
surprise asked whether the magistrates of the city intended to
refuse their sovereign admission. The symbolism of the pretty
custom was duly explained to him, but for all response the old
warrior curtly observed that "such usages had passed out of
fashion," and at the same instant cut the cord with his sword.
(Arcère, i. 349; Delmas, 80, 81.) Charles himself refused the
request of the mayor that he should swear to maintain the
city's privileges. After so inauspicious a beginning of his
visit, the inhabitants were not surprised to find the king,
during his stay, reducing the "corps-de-ville" from 100 to 24
members, under the presidency of a governor invested with the
full powers of the mayor; ordering that the artillery should
be seized, two of the towers garrisoned by foreign troops, and
the magistrates enjoined to prosecute all ministers that
preached sedition; or banishing some of the most prominent
Protestants from La Rochelle.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the government of Catharine de'
Medici&mdash;always destitute of a fixed policy, and consequently
always recalling one day what it had done the day before&mdash;that
scarcely two months elapsed before the queen mother put
everything back on the footing it had occupied before the
royal visit to La Rochelle. </p></blockquote>

is that given by François de la Noue in his Mémoires, chap. xi. It
clearly shows how much Davila mistakes in asserting that "the prince, the
admiral, and Andelot persuaded them, without further delay, to take
arms." (Eng. trans., London, 1678, bk. iv., p. 110.) Davila's careless
remark has led many others into the error of making Coligny the advocate,
instead of the opposer, of a resort to arms. See also De Thou, iv. (liv.
xlii.) 2-7, who bases his narrative on that of De la Noue, as does
likewise Agrippa d'Aubigné, l. iv., c. vii. (i. 209), who uses the
expression: "L'Amiral voulant endurer toutes extremitez et se confier en

handful of men broke through heavy battalions and attacked the opposing
general himself, the Moslem, in his admiration of their valor, twice
cried out: "Oh, that the grand seignior had a thousand such men as those

bearing Condé's head, with the designation of "Louis XIII.," have ever
been found. After the direct contradiction by Catharine de' Medici, no
other testimony is necessary. The Jesuits, however, impudently continued
to speak of Condé's treason as an undoubted truth, and even gave the
legend of the supposed coin as "Ludovicus XIII., Dei gratia, Francorum
Rex primus Christianus." See "Plaidoyé de Maistre Antoine Arnauld,

Anjou's main body failed to come up, and so Condé was saved. The blame
was thrown on Marshal Gonnor (Cossé) and on M. de Carnavalet, the king's
tutor, whom some suspected of unwillingness to allow so much noble blood
to be shed. Others accused the one of too much friendship with the
Châtillons, the other of a leaning to heresy ("de sentir le fagot")
Agrippa d'Aubigné, i. 227. See also Cl. Haton, i. 503. These two noblemen
were accused of advocating other designs which were very obnoxious to the
Roman Catholic party. "La vérité est," says Jehan de la Fosse, in his
journal, p. 90, under date of December, 1567, "que aulcuns grands
seigneurs entre lesquels on nomme Gonor [et] Carnavallet donnoient à

authority of Coustureau, Vie du duc de Montpensier, states that the
Rochellois had, after the peace of 1563, bought from Catharine de'
Medici, for 200,000 francs, the suppression of the garrison placed in
their city by the Duke of Montpensier, and remarks: "Ces 200,000 francs
coutèrent cher!" The authority, however, is very slender in the absence
of all corroborative evidence, and Arcère, more than a century ago,
showed (Histoire de la Rochelle, i. 625) how improbable, or, rather,
impossible the story is. If any gift was made to Catharine by the city,
it must have been far less than the sum, enormous for the times and
place, of 200,000 crowns; and, at any rate, it could not have been for
the purchase of a privilege already enjoyed for hundreds of years. See
the illustrative note at the end of this chapter.</p></div>

was returning, with a body-guard of about thirty-five men, from a visit
to his cousin, the duke, at Nice, where he had been treated with great
honor. When approaching Fréjus he perceived signs of treachery in a body
of men lurking under cover of a grove, and betook himself for safety into
the city, now, since his father's death, a part of the province of which
his eldest brother was royal governor. The tocsin was rung, and his
enemies, originally a band of three hundred men, being swollen by
constant accessions to four times that number, the house in which
Cipierre had taken refuge was assailed. After a heroic defence the small
party of defenders surrendered their arms, on assurance that their
opponents would at once retire. The papists, however, scarcely made a
pretence of fulfilling their compact, for they speedily returned and
massacred every one whom they found in the house. Cipierre himself was
not among the number. To secure him a new breach of faith was necessary.
The captain of the murderers pledged his own word to the magistrate that
if Cipierre would come forth from his hiding-place he would spare his
life. He discharged the obligation, so soon as Cipierre presented
himself, by plunging a dagger into his breast. J. de Serres, iii.

injunctions, as we have seen, decided the reluctant admiral to take up
arms in the first religious war (see <i>ante</i>, chapter xiii., p. 35), lay
dying of a disease contracted in her indefatigable labors for the sick
and wounded soldiers at Orleans, whilst the admiral was at the siege of
Chartres. On the conclusion of the peace he hastened to her, but was too
late to find her alive. In a touching letter, written to her husband
after all hope of seeing him again in this world had fled, a letter the
substance of which is preserved by one of his biographers (Vie de
Coligny, Cologne, 1686, p. 342), she lamented the loss of a privilege
that would have alleviated the sufferings of her last hours, but consoled
herself with the thought of the object for which he was absent. She
conjured him, by the love he bore her and to her children, to fight to
the last extremity for God and religion; warning him, lest through his
habitual respect for the king&mdash;a respect which had before made him
reluctant to take up arms&mdash;he should forget the obligations he owed to
God as his first Master. She begged him to rear the children she left him
in the pure religion, that they might one day be capable of taking his
place; and, for their sakes, implored him not to hazard his life
unnecessarily. She bade him beware of the house of Guise. "I do not
know," she added, "whether I ought to say the same thing of the queen
mother, as we are forbidden to judge evil of our neighbor; but she has
given so many marks of her ambition that a little distrust is excusable."
The earlier biographer of Coligny (Gasparis Colinii Vita, 1575, p. 63,
etc.) gives an affecting picture of the deep sorrow and pious resignation
of the admiral.</p></div>

(Vie de Coligny, p. 346) says that the concourse at Châtillon and Noyers
was so great that the Louvre was a desert in comparison! When ten
gentlemen left by one gate, twenty entered by another. The churches
raised a purse of 100,000 crowns, one-half of which was to go to him, and
the other half to the Prince of Condé; but, though nearly ruined by the
enormous expenses of his hospitality, he declined to receive his

narrated in the next chapter. Mr. Henry White is, of course, equally
wrong when he says (Massacre of St. Bartholomew, New York, 1868, p. 291):
"The admiral had gone to this charming retreat [Tanlay], to consult with
his brother, to whom it belonged, <i>and who had joined him there</i>," and

that the papal bull which L'Hospital opposed was dated at Rome on the

president of the Parisian parliament to administer the oath to the
Protestants of the capital. Yet, as early as on the 12th of May, 1568,
the English ambassador, Norris, wrote to Cecil that Anjou, a cruel enemy
of the Protestants, had a privy council of which Cardinal Lorraine was
the "chiefest" member, and his own chancellor, who sealed everything
submitted to him, "which thing he [the good olde chauncelor of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Having narrowly escaped falling into the hands of their treacherous
enemies, and finding themselves compelled once more to take up arms in
defence of their own lives and the liberties of their fellow-believers,
the Prince of Condé and Admiral Coligny resolved to institute a vigorous
contest. A single glance at the situation, the full dangers of which were
now disclosed by the tidings coming from every quarter, was sufficient to
convince them that in a bold and decided policy lay their only hope of
success. The Roman Catholics had, it is true, enjoyed rare opportunities
for maturing a comprehensive plan of attack; although the sequel seemed
to prove that they had turned these opportunities to little practical
use. But the Huguenots possessed countervailing advantages, in close
sympathy with each other, in fervid zeal for their common faith, as well
as in an organization all but perfect. Simultaneously with their flight
from Noyers, the prince and the admiral had sent out a summons addressed
to the Protestants in all parts of the kingdom, and this was responded to
with enthusiasm by great numbers of those who had been their devoted
followers in the two previous wars. Multitudes of young men, also, with
imaginations inflamed by the recital of the exploits of their fathers and
friends, burned to enroll themselves under such distinguished leaders.
Many were the stratagems resorted to by these aspirants for military
honors. Among others, the eminent historian, Theodore Agrippa d'Aubigné,
has left an amusing account of the adventures he passed through in
reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> Huguenot recruiting station. His prudent guardian had taken
the precaution to remove Agrippa's clothes every evening, in order to
prevent him from carrying out his avowed purpose of entering the army;
but one night, on hearing the report of the arquebuse&mdash;which a number of
his companions, bent on the same course, had fired as a signal near his
place of confinement&mdash;the youth boldly lowered himself to the ground by
the sheets of his bed, and, with bare feet and no other clothing than a
shirt, made his way to Jonzac. There, after receiving an outfit from some
Protestant captains, he jotted down at the bottom of the receipt which he
gave them in return, the whimsical declaration "that never in his life
would he blame the war for having stripped him, since he could not
possibly leave it in a sorrier plight than that in which he entered
it."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The court proscribes the reformed religion.</div>

<p>The resolution and enthusiasm of the Huguenots were greatly augmented by
the imprudent course of the court. Notwithstanding their own guilty
designs, Catharine and the Cardinal of Lorraine were taken by surprise
when the news reached them that Condé and Coligny had escaped, and that
the Huguenots were everywhere arming. So sudden an outbreak had not been
expected; and, while awaiting the muster of that portion of the troops
that had been dismissed, but was now summoned to assemble at Étaples on
the 10th of September,<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> it was thought best to quiet the agitated
minds of the people. A declaration was accordingly published, assuring
all the adherents of the reformed faith who remained at home and
furnished no assistance to the enemy, of the royal protection, Charles
promising, at the same time, to give a gracious hearing to their
grievances.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> But, as soon as the Roman Catholic forces began to
collect in large numbers, and the apprehension of a sudden assault by the
Huguenots died away, the court threw off the mask of conciliation, and
Charles was made to sign two laws unsurpassed for intolerance. The first
purported to be "an irrevocable and perpetual edict."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> It rehearsed the
various steps taken by Charles the Ninth and his brother Francis in
reference to the "so-called reformed religion," from the time of the
tumult of Amboise. It alluded to the edicts of July and of January&mdash;the
latter adopted by the queen mother, by advice of the Cardinals of Bourbon
and Tournon, of the constable, of Saint André, and others, because less
objectionable than an edict tolerating the worship of that religion
<i>within</i> the walls of the cities. None of these concessions, it asserted,
having satisfied the professors of the new faith, who had collected money
and raised troops with the intent of establishing another government in
place of that which God had instituted, the king now repealed the edicts
of toleration, and henceforth prohibited his subjects, of whatever rank
and in all parts of his dominions, on pain of confiscation and death,
from the exercise of any other religious rites than those of the Roman
Catholic Church. All Protestant ministers were ordered to leave France
within fifteen days. Quiet and peaceable laymen were promised toleration
until such time as God should deign to bring them back to the true fold;
and pardon was offered to all who within twenty days should lay down
their arms.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The second edict deprived all Protestant magistrates of
the offices they held, reserving, however, to those who did not take part
in the war, a certain portion of their former revenues.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>In order to give greater solemnity to the transaction, Charles, clothed
in robes of state and with great pomp, repaired to the parliament house,
to be present at the publication of the new edicts, and with his own
hands threw into the fire and burned up the previous edicts of
pacification. "Thus did his Royal Highness of France," writes a
contemporary German pam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>phleteer with intense satisfaction, "as was
seemly and becoming to a Christian supreme magistrate, <i>pronounce
sentence of death upon all Calvinistic and other heresies</i>."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Impolicy of this course.</div>

<p>Nothing devised by the papal party could have been better adapted to
further the Huguenot cause than the course it had adopted. The wholesale
proscription of their faith united the Protestants, and led every
able-bodied man to take up arms against a perfidious government, whose
disregard of treaties solemnly made was so shamefully paraded before the
world. "These edicts," admits the candid Castelnau, "only served to make
the whole party rise with greater expedition, and furnished the Prince of
Condé and the admiral with a handle to convince all the Protestant powers
that they were not persecuted for any disaffection to the government, but
purely for the sake of religion."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts to make capital of the proscriptive measures.</div>

<p>Efforts were not spared by the Guisard party to make capital abroad out
of the new proscriptive measures. Copies of the edicts, translated from
the French, were put into circulation beyond the Rhine, accompanied by a
memorial embodying the views presented by an envoy of Charles to some of
the Roman Catholic princes of the empire. The king herein justified
himself for his previous clemency by declaring that he had entertained no
other idea than that of allowing his subjects of the "pretended" reformed
faith time and opportunity for returning to the bosom of the only true
church. Lovers of peace and good order among the Germans were warned that
they had no worse enemies than the insubordinate and rebellious Huguenots
of his Very Christian Majesty's dominions, while the adherents of the
Augsburg Confession were distinctly given to understand that Lutheranism
was safer with the Turk than where Calvin's doctrines were
professed.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>To influence the princes the offices of skilled diplomatists were called
into requisition, but to no purpose. When Blandy requested the emperor,
in Charles's name, to prevent any succor from being sent to Condé from
Germany, Maximilian replied by counselling his good friend the king to
seek means to restore concord and harmony among his subjects, and
professing his own inability to restrain the levy of auxiliary troops.
And from Duke John William, of Saxony, the same envoy only obtained
expressions of regret that the war so lately suppressed had broken out
anew, and of discontent on the part of the German princes at the rumor
that Charles had been so ill advised as to join in a league made by the
Pope and the King of Spain, with the view of overwhelming the
Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A "crusade" preached at Toulouse.</div>

<p>On the other hand, the new direction taken by Catharine met with the most
decided favor on the part of the fanatical populace, and the pulpits
resounded with praise of the complete abrogation of all compacts with
heresy. The Roman Catholic party in Toulouse acted so promptly,
anticipating even the orders of the royal court, as to make it evident
that they had been long preparing for the struggle. On Sunday, the
twelfth of September, a league for the extermination of heresy was
published, under the name of a <i>crusade</i>. A priest delivered a sermon
with the consent of the Parliament of Toulouse. Next day all who desired
to join in the bloody work met in the cathedral dedicated to St.
Stephen&mdash;the Christian protomartyr having, by an irony of history, more
than once been made a witness of acts more congenial to the spirit of his
persecutors than to his own&mdash;and prepared themselves for their
undertaking by a common profession of their faith, by an oath to expose
their lives and property for the maintenance of the Roman Catholic
religion, and by confession and communion. This being done, they adopted
for their motto the words, "Eamus nos, moriamur cum Christo," and
attached to their dress a white cross to distinguish them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> their
Protestant fellow-citizens. Of success they entertained no misgivings.
Had not Attila been defeated, with his three hundred thousand men, not
far from Toulouse? Had not God so blessed the arms of "our good
Catholics" in the time of Louis the Eighth, father of St. Louis, that
eight hundred of them had routed more than sixty thousand heretics? "So
that we doubt not," said the new crusaders, "that we shall gain the
victory over these enemies of God and of the whole human race; and if
some of us should chance to die, our blood will be to us a second
baptism, in consequence of which, without any hinderance, we shall pass,
with the other martyrs, straight to Paradise."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> A papal bull, a few
months later (on the fifteenth of March, 1569), gave the highest
ecclesiastical sanction to the crusade, and emphasized the complete
extermination of the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fanaticism of the Roman Catholic preachers.</div>

<p>The faithful, but somewhat garrulous chronicler, who has left us so vivid
a picture of the social, religious, and political condition of the city
of Provins during a great part of the second half of this century,
describes a solemn procession in honor of the publication of the new
ordinance, which was attended by over two thousand persons, and even by
the magistrates suspected of sympathy with the Protestants. Friar Jean
Barrier, when pressed to preach, took for his text the song of Moses: "I
will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and
his rider hath He thrown into the sea." His treatment of the verse was
certainly novel, although the exegesis might not find much favor with the
critical Hebraist. The Prince of Condé was the <i>horse</i>, on whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> back
were mounted the Huguenot ministers and preachers&mdash;the <i>riders</i> who drove
him hither and thither by their satanic doctrine. Although they were not
as yet drowned, like Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, France had
great reason to rejoice and praise God that the king had annulled the
Edict of January, and other pernicious laws made during his minority. As
for himself, said the good friar, he was ready to die, like another
Simeon, since he had lived to see the edicts establishing "the Huguenotic
liberty" repealed, and the preachers expelled from France.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenot places of refuge.</div>

<p>Similar rejoicings with similar high masses and sermons by enthusiastic
monks, were heard in the capital<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> and elsewhere. But the jubilant
strains were sounded rather prematurely; for the victory was yet to be
won. The Huguenot nobles, invited by Condé, were flocking to La Rochelle;
the Protestant inhabitants of the towns, expelled from their homes, were
generally following the same impulse. But others, reluctant, or unable to
traverse such an expanse of hostile territory, turned toward nearer
places of refuge. Happily they found a number of such asylums in cities
whose inhabitants, alarmed by the marks of treachery appearing in every
quarter of France, had refused to receive the garrisons sent to them in
the king's name. It was a wonderful providence of God, the historian Jean
de Serres remarks. The fugitive Huguenots of the centre and north found
the gates of Vézelay and of Sancerre open to them. Those of Languedoc and
Guyenne were safe within the walls of Montauban, Milhau, and Castres. In
the south-eastern corner of the kingdom, Aubenas, Privas, and a few other
places afforded a retreat for the women and children, and a convenient
point for the muster of the forces of Dauphiny.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jeanne d'Albret and D'Andelot reach La Rochelle.</div>

<p>Meantime, the Queen of Navarre, with young Prince Henry and his sister
Catharine, started from her dominions near the Pyrenees. The court had in
vain plied her with conciliatory letters and messages sent in the king's
name. Gathering her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> troops together, and narrowly escaping the forces
despatched to intercept her, she formed a junction with a very
considerable body of troops raised in Périgord, Auvergne, and the
neighboring provinces, under the Seigneur de Piles, the Marquis de
Montamart, and others, and, after meeting the Prince of Condé, who came
as far as Cognac to receive her, found safety in the city of La
Rochelle.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>From an opposite direction, François d'Andelot, whom the outbreak of
hostilities overtook while yet in Brittany, was warned by Condé to hasten
to the same point. With his accustomed energy, the young Châtillon
rapidly collected the Protestant noblemen and gentry, not only of that
province, but of Normandy, Touraine, Maine, and Anjou, and with such
experienced leaders as the Count of Montgomery, the Vidame of Chartres,
and François de la Noue, had reached a point on the Loire a few miles
above Angers. It was his plan to seize and hold the city and bridge of
Saumur, and thus secure for the Huguenots the means of easy communication
between the two sides of the important basin intervening between the
smaller basins of the Seine and the Garonne. His expectations, however,
were frustrated principally by the good fortune of M. de Martigues, who
succeeded in making a sudden dash through D'Andelot's scattered
divisions, and in conveying to the Duke of Montpensier at Saumur so large
a reinforcement as to render it impossible for the Huguenots to dream of
dislodging him.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> For a time D'Andelot was in great peril. With only
about fifteen hundred horse and twenty-five hundred foot,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> he stood
on the banks of a river swollen by autumnal rains and supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> to be
utterly impassable, and in the midst of a country all whose cities were
in the hands of the enemy. He had even formed the desperate design of
retiring twenty or thirty miles northward, in hope of being able to
entice Montpensier to follow him so incautiously that he might turn upon
him, and, after winning a victory, secure for himself a passage to the
sources of the Loire or to his allies in Germany. At this moment the
joyful announcement was made by Montgomery that a ford had been
discovered. The news proved to be true. The crossing was safe and easy.
Not a man nor a horse was lost. The interposition of heaven in their
behalf was so wonderful, that, as the Huguenot troopers reached the
southern bank, the whole army, by common and irresistible impulse, broke
forth in praise to Almighty God, and sang that grand psalm of
deliverance&mdash;the seventy-sixth.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Never had those verses of Beza been

<div class="sidenote">Success in Poitou, Angoumois, etc.</div>

<p>Full of courage, the exultant troops of D'Andelot now pressed southward.
First the city of Thouars fell into their hands; then the more important
Partenay surrendered itself to the Huguenots. Here, according to the
cruel rules of warfare of the sixteenth century, they deemed themselves
justified in hanging the commander of the place, who had thrown himself
into the castle, for having too obstinately insisted upon standing an
assault in a spot incapable of defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> together with some priests who
had shared his infatuation.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Admiral Coligny now met his brother, and
the united army, with three cannon brought from La Rochelle, forming his
entire siege artillery, demanded and obtained the surrender of Niort, the
size and advantageous position of which made it a bulwark of La Rochelle
toward the east. Angoulême, Blaye, Cognac, Pons, and Saintes, were still
more valuable acquisitions. In short, within a few weeks, so large a
number of cities in the provinces of Poitou, Angoumois, and Saintonge had
fallen under the power of the Protestants, that they seemed fully to have
retrieved the losses they had experienced through the treacherous peace
of Longjumeau. "In less than two months," writes La Noue of his
fellow-soldiers, "from poor vagabonds that they were, they found in their
hands sufficient means to continue a long war."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> And the veteran
Admiral Coligny, amazed at the success attending measures principally
planned by himself, was accustomed to repeat with heartfelt thankfulness
the exclamation attributed to Themistocles: "I should be lost, if I had
not been lost!"<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Affairs in Dauphiny, Provence, and Languedoc.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Powerful Huguenot army in the south.</div>

<div class="sidenote">It effects a junction with Condé's forces.</div>

<p>Meantime, in the south-eastern part of France, the provinces of Dauphiny,
Provence, and Lower Languedoc, the Huguenots had not been slow in
responding to the call of the Prince of Condé. The difficulty was rather
in assembling their soldiers than in raising them; for there was little
lack of volunteers after the repeal of the royal edicts in favor of the
Protestants. With great trouble the contingents of Dauphiny and Provence
were brought across the Rhône, and at Alais the Baron d'Acier<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
mustered an army to go to the succor of the Prince of Condé at La
Rochelle. A Roman Catholic historian expresses his profound astonishment
that the Huguenots of this part of the kingdom, when surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> by the
violation of the peace, should so speedily have been able to mass a force
of twenty-five thousand men, well furnished and equipped, and commanded
by the most excellent captains of the age&mdash;Montbrun, Mouvans,
Pierre-Gourde, and others.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The abbé's wonder was doubtless equalled
by the consternation which the news spread among the enemies of the
Huguenots. The Roman Catholics could bring no army capable of preventing
the junction of D'Acier's troops with those of Condé; but the Duke of
Montpensier succeeded, on the twenty-fifth of October, in inflicting a
severe loss upon one of the divisions at Messignac, near Périgueux.
Mouvans and Pierre-Gourde, who were distant from the main body, were
attacked in their quarters, by a force under Brissac, which they easily
repulsed. D'Acier, suspecting the design of the enemy, had commanded the
Huguenot captains to make no pursuit, and to await his own arrival. But
brave Mouvans was as impatient of orders as he was courageous in battle.
Disregarding the authority which sat so lightly upon him, he fell into an
ambuscade, where he atoned for his rashness by the loss of his own life
and the lives of more than a thousand of his companions. After this
disaster, D'Acier experienced no further opposition, and, on the first of
November, he met the advancing army of Condé at Aubeterre, on the banks
of the Dronne.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>With the new accessions to his army, the prince commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> a force very
considerably larger than any he had led in the previous wars. Among the
conflicting statements, we may find it difficult to fix its numbers.
Agrippa d'Aubigné says that, after the losses consequent upon the defeat
of Messignac and those resulting from camp diseases, Condé's army
consisted of only seventeen thousand foot soldiers, and two thousand five
hundred horsemen.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> A Huguenot bulletin, sent from La Rochelle for the
information of Queen Elizabeth and the Protestants of England, may have
given somewhat too favorable a view of the prince's prospects, but was
certainly nearer the truth, in assigning him twenty-five thousand
arquebusiers and a cavalry force of five or six thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> On the
other hand, Henry of Anjou, who had been placed in nominal command of the
Roman Catholic army, had not yet been able to assemble a much superior,
probably not an equal, number of soldiers. The large forces which,
according to his ambassador at the English court, Charles the Ninth could
call out,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> existed only on paper. The younger Tavannes, whose father
was the true head of the royal army, gives it but about twenty thousand
men.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>It was already nearly winter when the armies were collected, and their
operations during the remainder of the campaign were indecisive. In the
numerous skirmishes that occurred the Huguenots usually had the
advantage, and sometimes inflicted considerable damage upon the enemy.
But the Duke of Anjou, or the more experienced leaders commanding in his
name, studiously avoided a general engagement. The instructions from the
court were to wear out the courage and enthusi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>asm of Condé's adherents
by protracting a tame and monotonous warfare.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The prince's true
policy, on the contrary, lay in decided action. His soldiers were
inferior to none in France. The flower of the higher nobility and the
most substantial of the middle classes had flocked to his standard so
soon as it was unfurled. But, without regular commissariat, and serving
at their own costs, these troops could not long maintain themselves in
the field.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> The nobles and country gentlemen, never too provident in
their habits, soon exhausted their ready funds, with their crowd of
hungry retainers, and became a more pitiable class than even the
burgesses. The latter, whom devotion to their religious convictions,
rather than any thirst for personal distinction, had impelled to enter
the service, could not remain many months away from their workshops and
counting-rooms without involving their families in great pecuniary
distress. It was not, however, possible for Condé and Coligny to bring
about a combat which the duke was resolved to decline, and the
unparalleled severity of the season suspended, at the same time, their
design of wresting from his hands the city of Saumur, a convenient point
of communication with northern France. Early in December the vines were
frozen in the fields,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> disease broke out in either camp, and the
soldiers began to murmur at a war which seemed to be waged with the
elements rather than with their fellow-men. While Anjou's generals,
therefore, drew off their troops to Saumur, Chinon on the Vienne, and
Poitiers, Condé's army went into winter quarters a little farther west,
at Montreuil-Bellay, Loudun and Thouars, but afterward removed, for
greater commodity in obtaining provisions, to Partenay and Niort.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot reprisals and negotiations.</div>

<p>It was while the Huguenots lay thus inactive that their leaders
deliberated respecting the best means of providing for their sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>port
during the coming campaign. Jeanne d'Albret, whose masculine vigor<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
had never been displayed more conspicuously than during this war, was
present, and assisted by her sage counsels. It was determined, in view of
the cruelties exercised upon the Protestants in those parts of the
kingdom where they had no strongholds, and of the confiscation of their
property by judicial decisions, to retaliate by selling the
ecclesiastical possessions in the cities that were now under Huguenot
power, and applying the proceeds to military uses. The order of sale was
issued under the names of the young Prince of Navarre, of Condé, Coligny,
D'Andelot and La Rochefoucauld, and a guarantee was given by them. As a
reprisal the measure was just, and as a warlike expedient nothing could
be more prudent; for, while it speedily filled the coffers of the
Huguenot army, it cut off one great source of the revenues of the court,
which had been authorized both by the Pope and by the clergy itself to
lay these possessions under contribution.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>Already the temper of the Protestant leaders had been sounded by an
unaccredited agent of Catharine de' Medici, who found Condé at Mirebeau,
and entreated him to make those advances toward a peace which would
comport better with his dignity as a subject than with that of Charles as
a king. But the prince, who saw in the mission of an irresponsible
mediator only a new attempt to impede the action of the confederates, had
dismissed him, after declaring, in the presence of a large number of his
nobles, that he had been compelled to resort to arms in order to provide
for his own defence. The war was, therefore, directed not against the
king, but against those capital enemies of the crown and of the realm,
the Cardinal of Lorraine and his associates. All knew his own vehement
desire for peace, of which his late excessive compliance was a sufficient
proof; but, since the king was surrounded by his ene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>mies, he intended,
with God's favor, to come and present his petitions to his Majesty in

<div class="sidenote">William of Orange attempts to aid the Huguenots.</div>

<p>Abroad the Huguenots had not been idle in endeavoring to secure the
support of advantageous alliances. So early as in the month of August,
after the disastrous defeat of Louis of Nassau, at Jemmingen, the Prince
of Orange had contemplated the formation of a league for common defence
with the Prince of Condé and Admiral Coligny. A draft of such an
agreement has been preserved; but it is unsigned, and may be regarded
rather as indicative of the friendly disposition of the French and Dutch
patriots than as a compact that was ever formally adopted.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> That same
autumn William of Orange had undertaken an expedition intended to free
the Netherlands from the tyranny of Alva. He had been met with consummate
skill. The duke refused to fight, but hung remorselessly on his skirts.
The inhabitants of Brabant extended no welcome to their liberator. The
prince's mercenaries, vexed at their reception, annoyed by the masterly
tactics of their enemy, and eager only to return to their homes, clamored
for pay and for plunder. Orange, outgeneralled, was compelled to abandon
the campaign, and would gladly have turned his arms against the
oppressors of his fellow-believers in France; but his German troops had
enlisted only for the campaign in the Netherlands, and peremptorily
declined to transfer the field of battle to another country. However, the
depth of the Meuse, which had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> unfordable, furnished more
persuasive arguments than could be brought forward by Genlis and the
Huguenots who with him had joined the Prince of Orange, and the army of
the patriots was forced to direct its course southward and to cross the
French frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consternation and devices of the court.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Declaration of the Prince of Orange.</div>

<p>Great was the consternation at the court of Charles. Paris trembled for
its safety, and vigorous were the efforts made to get rid of such
dangerous guests. Marshal Cossé, who commanded for his Majesty on the
Flemish border, was too weak to copy successfully the tactics of Alva;
but he employed the resources of diplomacy. His secretary, the Seigneur
de Favelles, not content with remonstrating against the prince's
violation of the territory of a king with whom he was at peace,
endeavored to terrify him by exaggerating the resources of Charles the
Ninth and by fabricating accounts of Huguenot reverses. Condé, he said,
had been forced to recross the river Vienne in great confusion; and there
was a flattering prospect that he would be compelled to shut himself up
in La Rochelle; for "Monseigneur the Duke of Anjou" had an irresistible
army of six thousand horse and twenty-five or thirty thousand foot,
besides the forces coming from Provence under the Count de Tende, the six
thousand newly levied Swiss brought by the Duke d'Aumale, and other
considerable bodies of troops.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Gaspard de Schomberg<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> was
despatched on a similar errand by Charles himself, and offered the
prince, if he came merely desiring to pass in a friendly manner through
the country, to furnish him with every facility for so doing. In reply,
William of Orange, although the refusal of his soldiers to fight against
Charles<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> left him no alternative but to embrace the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> course marked
out for him, did not disguise his hearty sympathy with his suffering
brethren in France. In view of the attempts made, according to his
Majesty's edict of September last, to constrain the consciences of all
who belonged to the Christian religion, and in view of the king's avowed
determination to exterminate the pure Word of God, and to permit no other
religion than the Roman Catholic&mdash;a thing very prejudicial to the
neighboring nations, where there was a free exercise of the Christian
religion&mdash;the prince declared his inability to credit the assertions of
his Majesty, that it was not his Majesty's intention to constrain the
conscience of any one. He avowed his own purpose to give oppressed
Christians everywhere all aid, comfort, counsel, and assistance;
asserting his conviction that the men who professed "the religion"
demanded nothing else than the glory of God and the advancement of His
Word, while in all matters of civil polity they were ready to render
obedience to his Majesty. He averred, moreover, that if he should
perceive any indications that the Huguenots were pursuing any other
object than liberty of conscience and security for life and property, he
would not only withdraw his assistance from them, but would use the whole
strength of his army to exterminate them.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> After this declaration,
the prince prosecuted his march to Strasbourg, where he disbanded his
troops, pawning his very plate and pledging his principality of Orange,
to find the means of satisfying their demands. Great was the delight of
the royalists, great the disappointment of the Huguenots, on hearing that
the expedition had vanished in smoke. "The army of the Prince of Orange,"
wrote an agent of Condé in Paris, "after having thrice returned to the
king's summons a sturdy answer that it would never leave France until it
saw religion re-established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> has retreated, in spite of our having given
it notice of your intention to avow it. I know not the cause of this
sudden movement, for which various reasons are alleged."<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> William the
Silent had not, however, relinquished the intention of going to the
assistance of the Huguenots, whose welfare, next to that of his own
provinces, lay near his heart. Retaining, therefore, twelve hundred
horsemen whom he found better disposed than the rest, he patiently
awaited the departure of the new ally of the French Protestants,
Wolfgang, Duke of Deux-Ponts (Zweibrücken), in whose company he had
determined to cross France with his brothers Louis and Henry of
Nassau.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>The Prince of Condé received more immediate and substantial assistance
from beyond the Channel. When Tavannes undertook to capture Condé and
Coligny at Noyers, it was in contemplation to seize Odet, Cardinal of
Châtillon, the admiral's elder brother,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> in his episcopal palace at
Beauvais. He received, however, timely warning, and made his escape
through Normandy to England, where Queen Elizabeth received him at her
court with marks of distinguished favor.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> His efforts to enlist the
sympathies and assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> the English monarch in behalf of his
persecuted countrymen were seconded by Cavaignes, who soon arrived as an
envoy from Condé. Cavaignes was instructed to ask material aid&mdash;money to
meet the engagements made with the Duke of Deux-Ponts, and ships with
their armaments to increase the small flotilla of privateersmen, which
the Protestants had, for the first time, sent out from La Rochelle. Soon
after appeared the vice-admiral, Chastelier-Pourtaut de Latour, under
whose command the flotilla had been placed, bearing a letter from the
Queen of Navarre to her sister of England, in which she was entreated to
espouse a quarrel that had arisen not from ambition or insubordination,
but from the desire, in the first place, to defend religion, and, next,
to rescue a king who was being hurried on to ruin by treacherous
advisers.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> To these reiterated appeals, and to the solicitations for
aid addressed to them by other refugees from papal violence who had found
their way to the shores of Great Britain, the subjects of the queen
returned a more gracious answer than the queen herself. The exiled
Huguenot ministers were received with open arms by men who regarded them
as champions of a common Christianity,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and some Protestant noblemen
had in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> weeks after their arrival raised for their relief, the
sum&mdash;considerable for those days&mdash;of one hundred pounds sterling. Not
only the laity, but even the clergy of the Church of England, took a
tender pride in receiving the "few servants of God"&mdash;some three or four
thousand&mdash;whom Providence had thrown upon their shores. They welcomed
them to their cities, and resented the attempts of Pope and king to
secure their extradition. Could the Pope, who harbored six thousand
usurers and twenty thousand courtesans in his own city of Rome, call upon
the Queen of England to deny the right of asylum to "the poor exiles of
Flanders and France, and other countries, who either lost or left behind
them all that they had&mdash;goods, lands, and houses&mdash;not for adultery, or
theft, or treason, but for the profession of the Gospel?" "It pleased
God," wrote Bishop Jewel, "here to cast them on land: the queen of her
gracious pity hath granted them harbor. Is it become so heinous a thing
to show mercy?" "They are our brethren," continued their noble-minded
advocate, "they live not idly. If they have houses of us, they pay rent
for them. They hold not our grounds but by making due recompense. They
beg not in our streets, nor crave anything at our hands, but to breathe
our air, and to see our sun. They labor truly, they live sparefully. They
are good examples of virtue, travail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> faith, and patience. The towns in

<div class="sidenote">Misgivings of Queen Elizabeth.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Her double-dealing and effrontery.</div>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was less decidedly in their favor. Her court swarmed with
creatures of the Spanish king, who openly gloried in the victories of the
Guises. The ambassadors of Charles and Philip strove to the utmost to
render the Huguenots odious to her mind, and to give a false coloring to
the war raging in France. Her jealousy of the royal prerogative was
appealed to, by the repeated declaration that the Protestants of France
were turbulent men, who, for the slightest occasion and upon the most
slender suspicion, were ready to have recourse to arms&mdash;enthusiasts, who
could not be dissuaded from rash enterprises; sectaries, who employed
their consistories and their organized form of church government to levy
men, to collect arms, munitions of war, and money&mdash;rebels, in fine, who
could at any moment rise within an hour, and surprise his most Christian
Majesty's cities and provinces. The abrogation of religious liberty was,
therefore, not merely advisable, but absolutely necessary. Elizabeth was
reminded, also, of her own intolerant measures toward the Roman Catholics
of her dominions; and she was assured that her fears of a combined attack
on all the Protestants were devoid of foundation&mdash;that Charles had
neither taken up arms, nor revoked the edicts of toleration at the desire
of any other prince, still less because of the instance of any private
individuals, but of his own free will, in order to secure his
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> These arguments, if they did not convince Elizabeth, gave
her a fair excuse for trying to maintain an appearance of
non-intervention, which the perilous position of England seemed to her to
dictate. With the problem of Scotland and Mary Stuart yet unsolved&mdash;with
a very considerable part of the lords and commons of her own kingdom
scarcely con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>cealing their affection for the Romish faith&mdash;she deemed it
hazardous to provoke too far the enmity of Philip the Second, her
brother-in-law, and a late suitor for her hand. As if any better way
could be found of warding off from her island the assaults of Philip than
by rendering efficient aid to Condé and Orange! As if England's
dissimulation and refusal to support the "Huguenots" and the "Gueux" in
any other than an underhand way were likely to retard the sailing of the
great expedition that was to turn the Pope's impotent threats against the
"bastard of England" into fearful realities! As if Protestantism,
everywhere menaced, could hope for glorious success in any other path
than a bold and combined defence!<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Unfortunately Elizabeth was fairly
launched on a sea of deceitful diplomacy, and not even Cecil could hold
her back. She gave La Mothe Fénélon, the French envoy, assurances that
would have been most satisfactory could he have closed his eyes to the
facts that gave these assurances the lie direct. At one time, with an
appearance of sincerity, she told the Spanish ambassador, it is true,
that she could not abandon the family of Châtillon, who had long been her
friends, whilst she saw the Guises, the declared enemies of her person
and state, in such authority, both in the council and the field; that she
could not feel herself secure, especially since a member of the French
council had inadvertently dropped the hint that, after everything had
been settled at home, Charles would turn his arms against England. She
had rather, consequently, anticipate than be anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> But to La
Mothe Fénélon himself she maintained unblushingly that, so far from
helping the French Protestants, "there was nothing in the world of which
she entertained such horror as of seeing a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> rising in rebellion
against its head, and that she had no notion of associating herself with
such a monster."<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> And again and again she protested that she was not
intriguing in France&mdash;that she had sent the Huguenots no assistance.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
At the same time Admiral Winter had been despatched with four or five
ships of war and a fleet of merchantmen, to carry to La Rochelle, in
answer to the request of Condé and of the Queen of Navarre, 100,000
"angelots" and six pieces of cannon and ammunition.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> When the
ambassador was commissioned to lay before the queen a remonstrance
against this flagrant breach of neutrality, and to demand an answer,
within fifteen days, respecting her intentions,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Elizabeth, in
declaring for peace, had the effrontery to assert that the assistance in
cannon and powder (for she denied that any money was left at La Rochelle)
was involuntary, not only with her, but even with the admiral himself.
Having dropped into the harbor to obtain the wine and other commodities
with which his fleet of merchantmen were to be freighted, Admiral Winter
was approached by the governor of the city, who so strongly pressed him
to sell or lend them some pieces of artillery and some powder, which they
could not do without, that, considering that he, as well as the ships,
were in their power, he thought it necessary to comply with a part of
their requests, although it was against his will.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Such were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
paltry falsehoods to which Elizabeth's insincere course naturally and
directly led. La Mothe Fénélon was well aware that Admiral Winter,
besides his public commission, had been furnished with a secret order,
authorizing him to assist La Rochelle, signed by Elizabeth's own hand,
without which the wary old seaman absolutely refused to go, doubtless
fearing that he might be sacrificed when it suited his mistress's crooked
policy. What the order contained was no mystery to the French envoy.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
Neither party in this solemn farce was deceived, but both wanted peace.
Catharine would have been even more vexed than surprised had Elizabeth
confessed the truth, and so necessitated a resort to open
hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> As the honor of the government was satisfied, even by
the notoriously false story of Winter's compulsion, there was no
necessity for pressing the question of its veracity to an inconvenient
length.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fruitless sieges and plots.</div>

<p>The cold winter of 1568-1569 passed without signal events, excepting the
great mortality among the soldiers of both camps from an epidemic
disease&mdash;consequent upon exposure to the extraordinary severity of the
season&mdash;and the fruitless siege of the city of Sancerre by the Roman
Catholics. Five weeks were the troops of Martinengo detained before the
walls of this small place, whose convenient proximity to the upper Loire
rendered it valuable to the Huguenots, not only as a means of
facilitating the introduction of their expected German auxiliaries into
central France, but still more as a refuge for their allies in the
neighboring provinces. The bravery of the besieged made them superior to
the forces sent to dislodge them. They repulsed, with great loss to their
enemies, two successive assaults on different parts of the works, and, at
last, gaining new courage from the advantages they had obtained, assumed
the offensive, and forced Martinengo and the captains by whom he had been
reinforced to retire humiliated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> hopeless undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Meantime, in not less than three important cities which the Huguenots
hoped to gain without striking a blow, the plans of those who were to
have admitted the Protestants within the walls failed in the execution;
and Dieppe, Havre, and Lusignan remained in the power of the Roman
Catholic party.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Growing superiority of Anjou's forces.</div>

<p>At the opening of the spring campaign the Prince of Condé found his
position relatively to his opponents by no means so favorable as at the
close of the previous year. His loss by disease equalled, his loss by
desertion exceeded, that of the Duke of Anjou; for it was impossible for
troops serving at their own expense, however zealous they might be for
the common cause, to be kept together, especially during a season of
inaction, so easily as the forces paid out of the royal treasury. Besides
this, the Duke of Anjou had received considerable reinforcements. Two
thousand two hundred German reiters, under the Rhinegrave and
Bassompierre, had arrived in his camp. They were the first division of a
force of five thousand six hundred men who had crossed the Rhine, near
the end of December, under Philibert, Marquis of Baden, and others. The
young Count de Tende brought three thousand foot soldiers from Provence
and Dauphiny, and smaller bodies came in from other parts of France.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
Condé, on the contrary, had received scarcely any accessions to his
troops. The "viscounts," whose arrival had turned the scale at the
conclusion of the last war, lingered in Guyenne, with an army of six
thousand foot soldiers and a well-appointed cavalry force, preferring to
protect the Protestant territories about Montauban and Castres, and to
ravage the lands of their enemies, as far as to the gates of Toulouse,
rather than leave their homes unprotected and join Condé. A dispute
respecting precedence had not been without some influence in causing the
delay, and M. de Piles, who had been twice sent to urge them forward, had
only succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> bringing a corps of one thousand two hundred
arquebusiers and two hundred horse.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> It was now expected, however,
that realizing the vital importance of opposing to Anjou a powerful
Protestant army, the viscounts would abandon their short-sighted policy;
and it was the intention of Condé and Coligny, after effecting a
junction, to march with the combined armies to meet the Duke of
Deux-Ponts. Anticipating this plan, the court had despatched the Dukes of
Aumale and of Nemours to guard the entrance into France from the side of
Germany. There seemed to be danger that the precaution would prove
ineffectual through the jealousy existing between the two leaders; but
this danger Catharine attempted to avert by removing the royal court to
Metz, where she could exert her personal influence in reconciling the
ambitious rivals.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> In order to prevent the threatened union of Condé
and the viscounts, the Duke of Anjou now left his winter quarters upon
the Loire and moved southward. On the other hand, the Prince of Condé
left Niort, and, pursuing a course nearly parallel, passed through St.
Jean d'Angely to Saintes, thence diverging to Cognac, on the
Charente.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The armies meet on the Charente.</div>

<p>The Charente, although by no means one of the largest rivers of France,
well deserves to be called one of the most capricious. For about a
quarter of its length it runs in a northwesterly direction. At Civray it
abruptly turns southward and flows in a meandering course as far as
Angoulême, receiving on the way the waters of the Tardouère (Tardoire),
and with it almost completely inclosing a considerable tract of land. At
Angoulême, the old whim regaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> supremacy, the Charente again bends
suddenly westward, and finally empties into the ocean below Rochefort,
through a narrow arm of the sea known as the Pertuis d'Antioche. The
tract of country included between the river and the shores of the Bay of
Biscay, comprising a large part of the provinces of Aunis and Saintonge,
was in the undisputed possession of the Huguenots. They held the right
bank of the river, and controlled the bridges. Here they intended to
await the arrival of the viscounts. Jarnac, an important town on this
side, a few miles above Cognac, Admiral Coligny with the advance guard of
the prince's army had wrested from the enemy. They had also recovered
Châteauneuf, a small place situated higher up, and midway between Jarnac
and Angoulême.</p>

<p>In pursuance of his plan, the Duke of Anjou, after crossing the Charente
near Ruffec, had moved around to the south side, determined to prevent
the junction of the two Huguenot armies. Once more Châteauneuf fell into
his hands; but the garrison, after retreating to the opposite bank, had
destroyed the bridge behind them. This bridge the Roman Catholics set
themselves at once to repair. At the same time they began the
construction of a bridge of boats in the immediate vicinity. While these
constructions were pushed forward with great vigor, the royal army
marched down as far as Cognac and made a feint of attack, but retired
after drawing from the walls a furious cannonade. It was now that
prudence demanded that the Protestant army should withdraw from its
advanced position with only the Charente between its vanguard and the far
superior forces of the enemy. This was the advice of Coligny and of
others in the council of war. But Condé prevented its prompt execution,
exclaiming: "God forbid that it should ever be said that a Bourbon fled
before his enemies!"<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Jarnac, March 13, 1569.</div>

<p>The bridges being now practicable, almost the whole army of Anjou was
thrown across the Charente under cover of the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>ness, during the night
of the twelfth and thirteenth of March, only a small force remaining on
the left bank to protect Châteauneuf and the passage. So skilfully was
this movement effected that it escaped the observation even of those
divisions of the Protestant army that were close to the point of
crossing. When at length the admiral was advised that the enemy were in
force on the northern bank, he at once issued the order to fall back
toward Condé and the main body of the Huguenots. Unfortunately, the
divisions of Coligny's command were scattered; some had been discontented
with the posts assigned them, and had on their own responsibility
exchanged them for others that better suited their fancy. The very
command to concentrate was obeyed with little promptness, and the
afternoon was more than half spent before Coligny, and D'Andelot, who was
with him, could begin the retreat. Never was dilatoriness more ill-timed.
The handful of men with the admiral, near the abbey and hamlet of Bassac,
fought with desperation, but could not ward off the superior numbers of
the enemy. La Noue, in command of the extreme rear, with great courage
drove back the foremost of the Roman Catholics, but was soon overpowered
and taken prisoner. His men were thrown in disorder upon D'Andelot, who,
by an almost superhuman effort, not only sustained the shock, but retook
and for a short time held the abbey. D'Andelot was, however, in turn
forced to yield the ground.</p>

<p>Meantime Coligny had called upon Condé for assistance, and the prince,
leaving his infantry to follow, had hurried back with the few horse that
were within reach, and now took position on the left. But it was
impossible for so unequal a struggle to continue long. The Huguenots were
outflanked and almost enclosed between their adversaries and the
Charente. It was a time for desperate and heroic venture. Coligny's
forces had lost the ground which they had been contesting inch by inch
about a raised causeway.</p>

<p>Condé himself had but three hundred knights. One of his arms he carried
in a sling, because of a recent injury. To render his condition yet more
deplorable, his thigh had just been broken, as he rode up, by a kick from
the unmanageable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> horse of his brother-in-law, La Rochefoucauld. The
prince was no coward. Turning to his little company of followers, he
exclaimed: "My friends, true noblesse of France, here is the opportunity
we have long wished for in vain! Our God is the God of Battles. He loves
to be so called. He always declares Himself for the right, and never
fails to succor those who serve Him. He will infallibly protect us, if,
after having taken up arms for the liberty of our consciences, we put all
our hope in Him. Come and let us complete what the first charges have
begun; and remember in what a state Louis of Bourbon entered into the
combat for Christ and for his native land!" Thus having spoken, he bent
forward, and, at the head of his devoted band, and under an ensign
bearing for device the figure of the Roman hero Marcus Curtius and the
singularly appropriate motto, "Doux le peril pour Christ et le Pays," he
dashed upon a hostile battalion eight hundred strong.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Louis, Prince of Condé.</div>

<p>The conflict was, in the judgment of that scarred old Huguenot warrior,
Agrippa d'Aubigné, the sharpest and most obstinate in all the civil
wars.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> At last Condé's horse was killed under him, and the prince was
unable to extricate himself. The day was evidently lost, and Condé,
calling two of the enemies' knights with whom he was acquainted, and the
life of one of whom he had on a former occasion saved, raised his visor,
made himself known, and surrendered. His captors pledged him their word
that his life should be spared, and respectfully endeavored to raise him
from the ground. Just at that moment another horseman rode up. It was
Montesquiou, captain of Anjou's guards, who came directly from his
master, and was charged&mdash;so it was said&mdash;with a secret commission. He
drew a pistol as he approached, and, without inquiring into the terms of
the capture, shot Condé in the back. The shot penetrated between the
joints of his armor, and caused almost instantaneous death. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>So perished a prince even more illustrious for his courage and
intrepidity than for his exalted rank&mdash;a prince who had conscientiously
espoused the reformed faith, and had felt himself constrained by his duty
to his God and to his fellow-believers to assert the rights of the
oppressed Huguenots against illegal persecution. "Our consolation," wrote
Jeanne d'Albret a few weeks later, "is that he died on the true bed of
honor, both for body and soul, for the service of his God and his king,
and the quiet of his fatherland."<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> So magnanimous a hero could not be
insensible to the invasion of his claims as the representative of the
family next in the succession to the Valois; but I cannot agree with
those who believe that, in his assumption of arms in three successive
wars, he was influenced solely, or even principally, by selfish or
ambitious motives. His devotion to the cause which he had espoused was
sincere and whole-souled. If his love of pleasure was a serious blot upon
his character, let charity at least reflect upon the fearful corruption
of the court in which he had been living from his childhood, and remember
that if Condé yielded too readily to its fascinations, and fell into
shameful excesses, he yet bore with meekness the pointed remonstrances of
faithful friends, and in the end shook off the chains with which his
enemies had endeavored to bind him fast.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> As a soldier, no one could

of the very first order, he had at least the good sense to adopt the
plans of Gaspard de Coligny, the true hero of the first four civil wars.
The relations between these two men were well deserving of admiration. On
the part of Condé there was an entire absence of jealousy of the
resplendent abilities and well-earned reputation of the admiral. On the
part of Coligny there was an equal freedom from desire to supplant the
prince either in the esteem of his followers or in military rank. Coligny
was inflexible in his determination to accept no honors or distinctions
that might appear to prejudice the respect due by a Châtillon to a prince
of royal blood.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>The Prince of Condé was, unfortunately, not the only Huguenot leader
murdered in cold blood at the battle of Jarnac. Chastelier-Pourtaut de
Latour, who, having lately brought his flotilla back in safety to La
Rochelle, had hastened to take the field with the Protestants, was
recognized after his capture as the same nobleman who, five years before,
had killed the Sieur de Charry at Paris, and was killed in revenge by
some of Charry's friends. Robert Stuart, the brave leader descended from
the royal house of Scotland, who was said to have slain Constable
Montmorency in the battle of St. Denis, was assassinated after he had
been talking with the Duke of Anjou, within hearing and almost in sight
of the duke, by one of the constable's adherents.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry of Navarre remonstrates against the perfidy.</div>

<p>These flagrant violations of good faith incurred severe ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>madversion. A
letter is extant, written by young Prince Henry of Navarre, or in his
name, to Henry of Anjou, on the twelfth of July, 1569, about four months
after the battle of Jarnac. He begins by answering the aspersions cast
upon his mother and himself, and by asserting that, if his age (which,
however, is not much less than that of Anjou) disqualifies him from
passing a judgment upon the present state of affairs, he has lived long
enough to recognize the instigators of the new troubles as the enemies of
the public weal. It is not Henry of Navarre, whose honors and dignities
are all dependent upon the preservation of France, who seeks the ruin of
the kingdom; but, rather, they seek its ruin who, in their eagerness to
usurp the crown, have gone the length of making genealogical searches to
prove their possession of a title superior to that of the Valois, "and
have learned how to sell the blood of the house of France against
itself,<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> <i>constraining the king</i>, as it were, <i>to make use of his
left arm to cut off his right</i>, so as more easily to wrest his sceptre
from him afterward." In reply to the statement of Anjou that Stuart alone
was killed in cold blood, Henry of Navarre affirms that he can enumerate
many others.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> "But I shall content myself with merely reminding you
of the manner in which the late Prince of Condé was treated, inasmuch as
it touches you, Sir, and because it is a matter well known and free of
doubt. For his death has left to posterity an example of as noted
treachery, bad faith and cruelty as was ever shown, seeing that those,
Sir, who murdered him could not be deterred from the perpetration of so
wicked an act by the respect they owed to the greatness of your blood, to
which he had the honor of being so nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> related, and that they dealt
with him as they would have done with the most miserable soldier of the
whole army."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>The Huguenot loss in the battle of Jarnac was surprisingly small in the
number of men killed. It is probable that, including prisoners, they lost
about four hundred men, or about twice as many as the Roman
Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> But the loss was in effect much more considerable. The
dead and the prisoners were the flower of the French nobility. Among
those that had fallen into the enemy's hands were the bastard son of
Antoine of Navarre, François de la Noue, Soubise, La Loue, and others of
nearly equal distinction. Of infantry the Huguenot army lost but few men,
as the regiments, with the exception of that of Pluviaut, did not enter
the engagement at all. Coming up too late, and finding themselves in
danger of falling into the hands of the enemy's victorious cavalry, they
evacuated Jarnac, crossed to the left bank of the Charente, and, after
breaking down the bridge, retreated leisurely toward Cognac. Admiral
Coligny, meantime, upon whom the command in chief now devolved, diverged
to the right, and conducted the cavalry in safety to Saintes. The Roman
Catholic army, apparently satisfied with the success it had gained, made
no attempt at pursuit.</p>

<p>The Duke of Anjou entered Jarnac in triumph. With him was brought the
corpse of the Prince of Condé, tied to an ass's back, to be afterward
exposed by a pillar of the house where Anjou lodged&mdash;the butt of the

<div class="sidenote">Exaggerated bulletins.</div>

<p>Henry of Anjou was not inclined to suffer his victory to pass unnoticed.
Almost as soon as the smoke of battle had cleared away, a careful
description of his exploit was prepared for circulation, and it was no
fault of the compiler if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> the account he gave was not sufficiently
flattering to the young prince's vanity. Condé's body had not been four
days in the hands of the Roman Catholics, before Anjou wrote to his
brother, the King of France, announcing the fact that he had already
despatched messengers with the precious document to the Pope and the Duke
of Florence, to the Dukes of Savoy, Ferrara, Parma, and Urbino, to the
Republic of Venice and the Duke of Mantua, and to Philip of Spain; while
copies were also under way, intended for the French ambassadors in
England and Switzerland, for the Parliaments of Paris, Bordeaux, and
Toulouse, the "prévôt des marchands," and the "échevins" of the capital,
and others.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope's sanguinary injunctions.</div>

<p>The exaggerated bulletins of the Duke of Anjou were received with great
demonstrations of joy by all the Roman Catholic allies of France. Pope
Pius the Fifth in particular sent warm congratulations to the "Most
Christian King" and to Catharine de' Medici. But he was very careful to
couple his expressions of thanks with an earnest recommendation to pursue
the work so auspiciously begun, even to the extermination of the detested
heretics. "The more kindly God has dealt with you and us," he promptly
wrote to Charles, "the more vigorously and diligently must you make use
of the present victory to pursue and destroy the remnants of the enemy,
and wholly tear up, not only the roots of an evil so great and which had
gathered to itself such strength, but even <i>the very fibres</i> of the
roots. Unless they be thoroughly extirpated, they will again sprout and
grow up (as we have so often heretofore seen happen), where your Majesty
least expects it." Pius pledged his word that Charles would succeed in
his undertaking, "if no respect for men or for human considerations
should be powerful enough to induce him to spare God's enemies, who had
spared neither God nor him." "In no other way," he added, "will you be
able to appease God, than by avenging the injuries done to God with the
utmost severity, by the merited punishment of most accursed men." And he
set as a warning before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> eyes of the French monarch the example of
King Saul, who, when commanded by God, through Samuel the Prophet, so to
smite the Amalekites, an infidel people, that none should escape, neither
man nor woman, neither infant nor suckling, incurred the anger and
rejection of the Almighty by sparing Agag and the best of the spoil,
instead of utterly destroying them.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>Two weeks later the pontiff received the unwelcome tidings that some of
the Huguenot prisoners taken in the battle of Jarnac had been spared. La
Noue, Soubise, and other gentlemen had actually been left alive, and were
likely to escape without paying the forfeit due to their crimes. At this
dreadful intelligence the righteous indignation of Pius was kindled. On
one and the same day (the thirteenth of April) he wrote long letters to
Catharine, to Anjou, to the Cardinal of Lorraine, to the Cardinal of
Bourbon, as well as to Charles himself.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Of all these letters the
tenor was identical. Such slackness to execute vengeance would certainly
provoke God's patience to anger; the king must visit condign punishment
upon the enemies of God and the rebels against his own authority. To the
victor of Jarnac he was specially urgent, supplicating him to counteract
any leanings that might be shown to an impious mercy. "Your brother's
rebels have disturbed the public tranquillity of the realm. They have, so
far as in them lay, subverted the Catholic religion, have burned
churches, have most cruelly slain the priests of Almighty God, have
committed numberless other crimes; consequently they deserve to receive
those extreme penalties (<i>supplicia</i>) that are ordained by the laws. And
if any of their number shall attempt, through the intercession of your
nobles with the king your brother, to escape the penalties they deserve,
it is your duty, in view of your piety to God and zeal for the divine
honor, to reject the prayers of all that intercede for them, and to show
yourself equally inexorable to all."<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The sanguinary action of the Parliament of Bordeaux.</div>

<p>Was it in consequence of the known desire of the occupant of the Holy See
that the policy of the French courts of justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> became more and more
sanguinary? We can scarcely doubt that the Pope's injunctions had much to
do with these increasing severities. Beginning in March, 1569, the
Parliament of Bordeaux issued a series of decrees condemning a crowd of
Protestants to death. The names that appear upon the records within the
compass of one year number not less than <i>twelve hundred and seventeen</i>.
The victims were taken out of all grades of society&mdash;from noblemen,
military men, judges, priests and monks, down to humble mechanics and
laborers. The lists made out by their enemies prove at least one fact
which the Huguenots had long maintained: that they counted in their ranks
representatives of the first families of the country, as well as of every
other class of the population. Happily sentence was pronounced generally
upon the absent, and the barbarous punishment of beheading, quartering,
and exposing to the popular gaze, remained unexecuted. But the incidental
penalty of the confiscation of the property of reputed Huguenots, which,
so far from being a mere formal threat, was in fact the principal object
contemplated by the prosecution, proved to be sober reality, and the
goods of the banished Protestants afforded rich plunder to the
informers.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Queen Elizabeth becomes colder.</div>

<p>Upon Elizabeth of England the first effect of the reported victory at
Jarnac was clearly marked. Her favorite, the Earl of Leicester, assured
the French ambassador that, although the queen was sorry to see those
professing her religion maltreated, yet, as queen, she would arm in
behalf of Charles when fighting against his own subjects.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Her own
declarations, however, were not so strong, or perhaps, after a little
reflection, she took a more hopeful view of the fortunes of the
Huguenots. For, although she exhibited curiosity to hear the "true"
account, which a special messenger from Charles the Ninth was
commissioned to bring her, and received the tidings in a manner
satisfactory to the French am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>bassador, she would not rejoice at the
death of Condé, whom she held to be a very good and faithful servant of
his Majesty's crown, and deplored a war which, whether victory inclined
to one side or the other, must lead to the diminution of Charles's best
forces and the ruin of his noblesse.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spirit of the Queen of Navarre.</div>

<p>In point of fact, however, the defeat which the royalists had flattered
themselves would terminate the war, and over which they had sung Te
Deums, weakened the Huguenots very little.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> The Queen of Navarre, on
hearing the intelligence, hurried to Cognac, where she presented herself
to the army, and reminded the brave men who heard her voice that,
although the Prince of Condé, their late leader, was dead, the good cause
was not dead; and that the courage of such good men ought never to fail.
God had provided, and ever would provide, fresh instruments to uphold His
own chosen work. Her brief address restored the flagging spirits of the
fugitives. When she returned to La Rochelle, to devise new means of
supplying the necessities of the army, she left behind her men resolved
to retrieve their recent losses. They did not wait long for an
opportunity. The Roman Catholics, advancing, laid siege to Cognac,
confident of easy success. But the garrison, which included seven
thousand infantry newly levied, received them with determination. Sallies
were frequent and bloody, and when, at last, the siege was raised, the
army of Anjou had sacrificed nearly as many men before the walls of a
small provincial city as the Huguenots had lost on the much vaunted field
of Jarnac.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenots recover strength.</div>

<p>The events of the next two or three months certainly exhibited no
diminution in the power or in the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> Huguenots. St. Jean
d'Angely, into which Count Montgomery had thrown himself, defied the
entire army of Anjou, and the siege was abandoned. Angoulême, an equally
tempting morsel, he tried to obtain, but failed. At Mucidan, a town
somewhat to the south-west of Périgueux, he was more successful. But he
effected its capture at the expense of the life of Brissac, one of his
bravest officers&mdash;a loss which he attempted to avenge by murdering the
garrison, after it had surrendered on condition that life and property
should be spared.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Within a month or two after the battle of Jarnac
the Protestants at La Rochelle wrote, for Queen Elizabeth's information,
that they were more powerful than ever, that Piles had brought them 4,000
recruits, that D'Andelot was soon to bring the viscounts with a large
force.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of D'Andelot.</div>

<p>But the course of that indefatigable warrior was now run. D'Andelot's
excessive labors and constant exposure had brought on a fever to which
his life soon succumbed. There were not wanting those, it is true, who
ascribed his sudden death, like most of the deaths of important
personages in the latter part of this century, to poison; and Huguenot
and loyal pamphleteers alike laid the crime at the door of Catharine de'
Medici.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> But there is no sufficient evidence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> substantiate the
accusation, and we must not unnecessarily ascribe this base act to a
woman already responsible for too many undeniable crimes.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> The death
of so gallant and true-hearted a nobleman, a faithful and unflinching
friend of the Reformation from the time when it first began to spread
extensively among the higher classes of the French population, and who
had amply atoned for a momentary act of weakness, in the time of Henry
the Second, by an uncompromising profession of his religion on every
occasion during the reigns of that monarch's two sons, was deeply felt by
his comrades in arms. As "colonel-general of the French infantry," he had
occupied the first rank in this branch of the service,<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> and his
experience was as highly prized as his impetuous valor upon the field of
battle. The brilliancy of his executive abilities seemed to all beholders
indispensable to complement the more calm and deliberative temperament of
his elder brother. It was natural, therefore, that the admiral, while
pouring out his private grief for one who had been so dear to him, in a
touching letter to D'Andelot's children,<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> should experience as deep a
sorrow for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> the loss of his wise and efficient co-operation. He might be
pardoned a little despondency as he recalled the prophetic words that had
dropped from D'Andelot's lips during a brief respite from his burning
fever: "France shall have many woes to suffer with you, and then without
you; but all will in the end fall upon the Spaniard!"<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> The prospect
was not bright. Peace was yet far distant&mdash;peace, which Coligny preferred
a thousand times to his own life, but would not purchase dishonorably by
the sacrifice of civil liberty and of the right to worship his God
according to the convictions of his heart and conscience. The burden of
the defence of the Protestants had appeared sufficiently heavy when
Condé, a prince of the blood, was alive to share it with him. But now,
with the entire charge of maintaining the party against a powerful and
determined enemy, who had the advantage of the possession of the person
of the king, and thus was able to cloak his ambitious designs with the
pretence of the royal authority, and deprived of a brother whom the army
had appropriately surnamed "le chevalier sans peur,"<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> the task might
well appear to demand herculean strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New responsibility imposed on Admiral Coligny.</div>

<p>Henry of Navarre had, indeed, just been recognized as general-in-chief,
and he was accompanied by his cousin, Henry of Condé; but Navarre was a
boy of little more than fifteen, and his cousin was not much older.
Nothing could for the present be expected from such striplings; and the
public, ever ready to look upon the comical side of even the most serious
matters, was not slow in nicknaming them the "admiral's two pages."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
Coligny, however, was not crushed by the new responsibility which
devolved upon him. No longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> hampered by the authority of one whose
counsels often verged on foolhardiness, he soon exhibited his consummate
abilities so clearly, that even his enemies were forced to acknowledge
that they had never given him the credit he deserved. "It was soon
perceived," observes an author by no means friendly to the Huguenots,
"that the accident (of Condé's death) had happened only in order to
reveal in all its splendor the merits of the Admiral de Châtillon. The
admiral had had during his entire life very difficult and complicated
matters to unravel, and, nevertheless, he had never had any that were not
far below his abilities, and in which, consequently, he had no need of
exerting his full capacity. Thus those qualities that were rarest, and
that exalted him most above others, remained hidden, through lack of
opportunity, and would apparently have remained always concealed during
the lifetime of the Prince of Condé, because the world would have
attributed to the prince all those results to whose accomplishment it
could not learn that the admiral had contributed more than had the
former. But, after the battle of Jarnac had permitted the admiral to
exhibit himself fully on the most famous theatre of Europe, the
Calvinists perceived that they were not so unhappy as they thought, since
they still had a leader who would prevent them from noticing the loss
they had experienced, so many singular qualities had he to repair
it."<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Duke of Deux Ponts comes with German auxiliaries.</div>

<p>Wolfgang, Duke of Deux Ponts, had at length entered France, and was
bringing to the Huguenots their long-expected succor. He had seven
thousand five hundred reiters from lower Germany, six thousand
lansquenets from upper Germany, and a body of French and Flemish
gentlemen, under William of Orange and his brother, Mouy, Esternay and
others, which may have swelled his army to about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> seventeen thousand men
in all.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> In vain did his cousin, the Duke of Lorraine, attempt to
dissuade him, offering to reimburse him the one hundred thousand crowns
he had already spent upon the preparations for the expedition. Even
Condé's death did not discourage him. He came, he said, to fight, not for
the prince, but for "the cause."<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> When about entering his Most
Christian Majesty's dominions, he had published the reasons of his coming
to assist the Huguenots. In this paper he treated as pure calumnies the
accusations brought by their enemies against Condé, Coligny, and their
associates, and proved his position by quoting the king's own express
declaration, in the recent edicts of pacification, "that he recognized
everything they had attempted as undertaken by his orders and for the
good of the kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> The point was certainly well taken. Charles's
various declarations were not remarkably consistent. In one, Condé was
"his faithful servant and subject," and his acts were prompted by the
purest of motives. In the next, he and his fellow-Huguenots were
incorrigible rebels, with whom every method of conciliation had signally
failed. But Charles did not trouble himself to attempt to smooth away
these contradictions. He is even said to have replied to the envoy whom
Deux Ponts sent him (April, 1569), demanding the restitution of the Edict
of January and the payment of thirty thousand crowns due to Prince
Casimir, that "Deux Ponts was too insignificant a personage (<i>trop petit
compagnon</i>) to undertake to dictate laws to him, and that, as to the
money, he would deliberate about <i>that</i> when the duke had laid down his
arms."<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p><p>The secret of this arrogant demeanor is found in the fact that the court
believed it impossible for the Germans to join Coligny. Even so late as
the middle of May, when Deux Ponts had penetrated to Autun in Burgundy,
Charles regarded the attempt as well nigh hopeless. The fortunes of the
Huguenots were desperate. "There remains for them as their last resort,"
he wrote to one of his ambassadors, "but the single hope that the Duke of
Deux Ponts will venture so far as to go to find them where they are. But
there is little likelihood that an army of strangers, pursued by another
of about equal strength&mdash;an army destitute of cities of its own, without
means of passing the rivers, favored by no one in my kingdom, dying of
hunger, so often harassed and put to inconvenience&mdash;should be able to
make so long a journey without being lost and dissipated of itself, even
had I no forces to combat it." "The duke," continued the king, "will soon
repent of his mad project of entering France, and attempting to cross the
Loire, where such good provision has been made to obstruct him."<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">They overcome all obstacles and join Coligny.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Deux Ponts.</div>

<p>Charles had not exaggerated the difficulties of the undertaking; but Deux
Ponts, under the blessing of Heaven, surmounted them all. The discord
between Aumale and Nemours rendered weak and useless an army that might,
in the hands of a single skilful general, have checked or annihilated
him.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Mouy and his French comrades were good guides. The Loire was
reached, while Aumale and Nemours followed at a respectful distance.
Guerchy, an officer lately belonging to Coligny's army, discovered a ford
by which a part of the Germans crossed. The main body laid siege to the
town of La Charité, which was soon reduced (on the twentieth of May), the
Huguenots thus gaining a bridge and stronghold that proved of great
utility for their future operations. Six days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> after the king had
demonstrated the impossibility of the enterprise, Deux Ponts was on the
western side of the Loire.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Meantime, Coligny and La Rochefoucauld
were advancing to meet him with the élite of their army and with all the
artillery they had. On approaching Limoges on the Vienne, they learned
that the Germans had crossed the river and were but two leagues distant.
Coligny at once took horse, and rode to their encampment, in order to
greet and congratulate their leader. He was too late. The general, who
had conducted an army five hundred miles through a hostile country, was
in the last agonies of death, and on the next day (the eleventh of June)
fell a victim to a fever from which he had for some time been suffering.
"It is a thing that ought for all time to be remarked as a singular and
special act of God," said a bulletin sent by the Queen of Navarre to
Queen Elizabeth, "that He permitted this prince to traverse so great an
extent of country, with a great train of artillery, infantry, and
baggage, and in full view of a large army; and to pass so many rivers,
and through so many difficult and dangerous places, of such kind that it
is not in the memory of man that an army has passed through any similar
ones, and by which a single wagon could not be driven without great
trouble, so that it appears a dream to those who have not seen it; and
that being out of danger, and having arrived at the place where he longed
to be, in order to assist the churches of this realm, God should have
been pleased, that very day, to take him to Himself; and, what is more,
that his death should have produced no change or commotion in his
army."<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>Duke Wolfgang of Deux Ponts was quietly succeeded in the command of the
German troops by Count Wolrad of Mansfeld. A day later the two armies met
with lively demonstrations of joy. In honor of the alliance thus cemented
a medal was struck, bearing on the one side the names and portraits of
Jeanne and Henry of Navarre, and on the other the significant words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
"<i>Pax certa, victoria integra, mors honesta</i>"&mdash;the triple object of their
desires.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot success at La Roche Abeille.</div>

<p>The combined army, now numbering about twenty-five thousand men, soon
came to blows with the enemy. The Duke of Anjou, whose forces were
somewhat superior in numbers, had approached within a very short distance
of Coligny, but, unwilling to risk a general engagement, had intrenched
himself in an advantageous position. A part of his army, commanded by
Strozzi, lay at La Roche Abeille, where it was furiously assaulted by the
Huguenots. Over four hundred royalists were left dead upon the field, and
Strozzi himself was taken prisoner. The disaster had nearly proved still
more serious; but a violent rain saved the fugitives by extinguishing the
lighted matches upon which the infantry depended for the discharge of
their arquebuses, and by seriously impeding the pursuit of the
cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Furlough of Anjou's troops.</div>

<p>Although the Duke of Anjou had recently received considerable
reinforcements&mdash;about five thousand pontifical troops and twelve hundred
Florentines, under the command of Sforza, Count of Santa Fiore<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>&mdash;it
was now determined in a military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> council to disband the greater part of
the army, giving to the French forces a short furlough, and, for the most
part, trusting to the local garrisons to maintain the royal supremacy in
places now in the possession of the Roman Catholics. In adopting this
paradoxical course, the generals seem to have been influenced partly by a
desire to furnish the "gentilhommes," serving at their own expense, an
opportunity to revisit their homes and replenish their exhausted purses,
and thus diminish the temptation to desertion which had thinned the
ranks; partly, also, by the hope that the new German auxiliaries of the
Huguenots would of themselves melt away in a climate to which they were
unaccustomed.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot petition to the king.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the admiral, whose power had never been so great as it now
was, exhibited the utmost anxiety to avert, if possible, any further
effusion of blood. Under his auspices a petition was drawn up in the name
of the Queen of Navarre, and the Princes, Seigneurs, Chevaliers, and
gentlemen composing the Protestant army. A messenger was sent to the Duke
of Anjou to request a passport for the deputies who were to carry it to
the court. But the duke was unwilling to terminate a war in which he had
(whether deservedly or not) acquired so much reputation, and reluctant to
be forced to resume the place of a subject near a brother whose
capricious and jealous humor he had already experienced. He therefore
either refused or delayed compliance with the admiral's demand.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
Coligny succeeded, however, in forwarding the document to his cousin
Francis, Marshal of Montmorency&mdash;a nobleman who, although he had not
taken up arms with the Huguenots, virtually maintained, on his estates
near Paris, a neutrality which, from the suspicion it excited, was not
without its perils. Montmorency laid the petition before Catharine and
the king. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The single purpose of the Huguenots.</div>

<p>The voluminous state papers of the period would possess little claim to
our attention, were it not for the singleness of purpose which they
exhibit as animating the patriotic party through a long succession of
bloody wars. The Huguenots were no rebels seeking to undermine the
authority of the crown, no obstinate democrats striving to carry into
execution an impracticable scheme of government,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> no partisans
struggling to supplant a rival faction. They were not turbulent lovers of
change. They had for their leaders princes and nobles with interests all
on the side of the maintenance of order, men whose wealth was wasted,
whose magnificent palaces were plundered of their rich contents,<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
whose lives, with the lives of their wives and children, were jeoparded
in times of civil commotion. Even the unauthorized usurpations of the
foreigners from Lorraine<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> have been sufficient to move the
greater part of them to a resort to the sword. Their one purpose, the
sole object which they could not renounce, was the securing of religious
liberty. The Guises&mdash;even that cruel and cowardly cardinal with hands
dripping with the blood of the martyrs of a score of years&mdash;were nothing
to them, except as impersonations of the spirit of intolerance and
persecution. Liberty to worship their God in good conscience was their
demand alike after defeats and after successes, under Louis de Bourbon or
under Gaspard de Coligny. They did, indeed, sympathize with the first
family of the blood, deprived of the position near the throne to which
immemorial custom entitled it&mdash;and what true Frenchman did not? But
Admiral Coligny, rather than the Prince of Condé, was the type of the
Huguenot of the sixteenth century&mdash;Coligny, the heroic figure that looms
up through the mist of the ages and from among the host of meaner men,
invested with all the attributes of essential greatness&mdash;pious, loyal,
truthful, brave, averse to war and bloodshed, slow to accept provocation,
resolute only in the purpose to secure for himself and his children the
most important among the inalienable prerogatives of manhood, the freedom
of professing and practising his religious faith.</p>

<p>The present petition differed little from its predecessors. It reiterated
the desire of the Huguenots for peace&mdash;a desire evidenced on so many
occasions, sometimes when prudence might have dictated a course opposite
to that which they adopted. The return they had received for their
moderation could be read in broken edicts, and in "pacifications" more
sanguinary than the wars they terminated. The Protestant princes and
gentlemen, therefore, entreated Charles "to make a declaration of his
will respecting the liberty of the exercise of the reformed religion in
the form of a solemn, perpetual, and irrevocable edict." They begged him
"to be pleased to grant universally to all his subjects, of whatever
quality or condition they might be, the free exercise of that religion in
all the cities, villages, hamlets, and other places of his kingdom,
without any exception, reservation, modification, or restriction as to
persons, times, or localities, with the necessary and requisite
securities." True,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> however, to the spirit of the age, which dreaded
unbridled license of opinion as much as it did the intolerance of the
papal system, the Huguenots were careful to preclude the "Libertines"
from sheltering themselves beneath this protection, by calling upon
Charles to require of all his subjects the profession of the one or the
other religion<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>&mdash;so far were even the most enlightened men of their
country and period from understanding what spirit they were of, so far
were they from recognizing the inevitable direction of the path they were
so laboriously pursuing!</p>

<p>It scarcely needs be said that the petition received no attention from a
court not yet tired of war. Marshal Montmorency was compelled to reply to
Coligny, on the twentieth of July, that Charles refused to take notice of
anything emanating from the admiral or his associates until they should
submit and return to their duty. Coligny answered in a letter which
closed the negotiations; protesting that since his enemies would listen
to no terms of accommodation, he had, at least, the consolation of having
done all in his power to avert the approaching desolation of the kingdom,
and calling upon God and all the princes of Europe to bear witness to the
integrity of his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disastrous siege of Poitiers.</div>

<p>The Huguenots now took some advantage of the temporary weakness of the
enemy in the open field. On the one hand they reduced the city of
Châtellerault and the fortress of Lusignan, hitherto deemed
impregnable.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> On the other, they despatched into Béarn the now famous
Count Montgomery, who, joining the "viscounts," was successful in
wresting the greater part of that district from the hands of Terrides, a
skilful captain sent by Anjou, and in restoring it to the Queen of
Navarre.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> Respecting their plan of future operations a great
diversity of opinion prevailed among the Huguenot leaders. Admiral
Co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>ligny was strongly in favor of pressing on to the north, and laying
siege to Saumur. With this place in his possession, as it was reasonable
to suppose it soon might be, he would enjoy a secure passage across the
river Loire into Brittany, Anjou, and more distant provinces, as he
already had access by the bridge of La Charité to Burgundy, Champagne,
and the German frontier. Unfortunately the majority of the generals
regarded it as a matter of more immediate importance to capture Poitiers,
a rich and populous city, said at that time to cover more ground than any
other city in France, with the single exception of Paris. They supposed
that their recent successes at Châtellerault and Lusignan, on either side
of Poitiers, and the six pieces of cannon they had taken at Lusignan
would materially help them. Coligny reluctantly yielded to their urgency,
and the army which had appeared before Poitiers on the twenty-fourth of
July, 1569,<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> began the siege three days later. It was a serious
blunder. The Huguenots succeeded, indeed, in capturing a part of the
suburbs, and in reducing the garrison to great straits for food; but they
were met with great determination, and with a singular fertility of
expedient. The Count de Lude was the royal governor. Henry, Duke of Guise
(son of the nobleman assassinated near Orleans in 1563), with his brother
Charles, Duke of Mayenne, and other good captains, had thrown himself
into Poitiers two days before Coligny made his appearance. It was Guise's
first opportunity to prove to the world that he had inherited his
father's military genius; and the glory of success principally accrued to
him. He met the assailants in the breach, and contested every inch of
ground. Their progress was obstructed by chevaux-de-frise and other
impediments. Boiling oil was poured upon them from the walls. Burning
hoops were adroitly thrown over their heads. Pitch and other inflammable
substances fell like rain upon their advancing columns. They were not
even left unmolested in their camp. A dam was constructed on the river
Clain, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> inundation spread to the Huguenot quarters. To these
difficulties raised by man were added the ravages of disease. Many of the
Huguenot generals, and the admiral himself, were disabled, and the
mortality was great among the private soldiers.</p>

<p>In spite of every obstacle, however, it seemed probable that Coligny
would carry the day. "The admiral's power exceedeth the king's," wrote
Cecil to Nicholas White: "he is sieging of Poitiers, the winning or
losing whereof will make an end of the cause. He is entered within the
town by assault, but the Duke of Guise, etc., are entrenched in a
stronger part of the town; and without the king give a battle, it is
thought that he cannot escape from the admiral."<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Just at this
moment, the Duke of Anjou, assembling the remnants of his forces,
appeared before Châtellerault; and the peril to the Huguenot city seemed
so imminent, that Coligny was compelled to raise the siege of Poitiers,
on the ninth of September, and hasten to its relief. Seven weeks of
precious time had been lost, and more than two thousand lives had been
sacrificed by the Huguenots in this ill-advised undertaking. The besieged
lost but three or four hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> Great was the delight manifested
in Paris, where, during the prevalence of the siege, solemn processions
had gone from Notre Dame to the shrine of Sainte Geneviève, to implore
the intercession of the patron of the city in behalf of Poitiers.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Huguenots had been more fortunate on the upper Loire, where
La Charité sustained a siege of four weeks by a force of seven thousand
Roman Catholics under Sansac. Its works were weak, its garrison small,
but every assault was bravely met. In the end the assailants, after
severe losses experienced from the enemy and from a destructive explosion
of their own magazine, abandoned their enterprise in a panic, on hearing
an ill-founded rumor of Coligny's approach.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cruelties to the Huguenots in the prisons of Orleans.</div>

<p>It was fortunate for the Protestants of the north and east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> that they
still had Sancerre and La Charité as asylums from the violence of their
enemies. Far from their armed companions, there was little protection for
their lives or their property. The edict of the preceding September,
assuring to peaceable Protestants freedom from molestation in their
homes, was as much a dead letter as any of its predecessors. The
government, the courts of justice, and the populace, were equally eager
to oppress them. At Orleans the "lieutenant-general" placed all the
Huguenots of the city, without distinction of age or sex, in the public
prisons, upon pretext of providing for the public security. A few days
after (on the twenty-first of August) the people, inflamed to fanaticism
by seditious priests, attacked these buildings. They succeeded in
breaking into the first prison, and every man, woman, and child was
murdered. The door of the second withstood all their attempts to gain
admission. But the bloodthirsty mob would not be balked of its prey. The
whole neighborhood was ransacked for wood and other combustible
materials, and willing hands kindled the fire. As the flames rose high
above the doomed house, parents who had lost all hope of saving their own
lives sought to preserve the lives of their infant children by throwing
them to relatives or acquaintances whom they recognized among their
persecutors. But there are times when the heart of man knows no pity. The
laymen who had been taught that heretics must be exterminated, even to
the babe in the cradle, now put into practice the savage lesson they had
learned from their spiritual instructors. Fathers and brothers took a
cruel pleasure in receiving the hapless infants on the point of their
pikes, or in despatching them with halberds, reserving the same fate for
any of more mature age who might venture to appeal from the devouring
flames to their merciless fellow-men. The number of the victims of sword
and fire is said to have reached two hundred and eighty persons.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Montargis a safe refuge.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Flight of the refugees to Sancerre.</div>

<p>The tragic end of the Huguenots at Orleans warned the Protestants of the
villages and open country of the dangers to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> they were exposed.
Many fled with their wives and children to Montargis, where the aged
Renée of Ferrara was still living, the unwilling spectator of commotions
which she had foreseen and predicted, and which she had striven to
prevent. Her palace was still what Calvin had called it in the time of
the first war, "God's hostelry." Renée's royal descent, her connection by
marriage with the Guises&mdash;for Henry, the present duke, was her
grandson&mdash;her well-known aversion to civil war,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and, added to these,
that demeanor which ever betrayed a consciousness that she was a king's
daughter, had thus far protected her from direct insult, staunch and
avowed Protestant as she was, and had enabled her to extend to a host of
fugitives for religion's sake a hospitality which had not yet been
invaded. But, the rancor entertained by the two parties increasing in
bitterness as the third conflict advanced, it became more and more
difficult to repress the impatience felt by the fanatics of Paris to rid
themselves of an asylum for the adherents of the hated faith within so
short a distance&mdash;about seventy miles&mdash;of the orthodox capital. Montargis
was narrowly watched. Early in March the duchess was warned, in a letter,
of pretended plans formed by the refugees on her lands to succor their
friends elsewhere in the vicinity&mdash;the writer being no other than the
adventurer Villegagnon, the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> vice-admiral, the betrayer of
Coligny's Huguenot colony to Brazil, who was now in the Roman Catholic
service, under the Duke of Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> But the fresh flood of refugees to
Montargis rendered further forbearance impossible. The preachers stirred
up the people, and the people incited the king. Renée was told that she
must dismiss the Huguenot preachers, or submit to receiving a Roman
Catholic garrison in her castle; that the exercise of the Protestant
religion could no longer be tolerated, and the fugitives must find
another home. The duchess could no longer resist the superior forces of
her enemies, and tearfully she provided the miserable Huguenots for their
journey with such wagons as she could find. The company consisted of four
hundred and sixty persons, two-thirds women and infants in the arms of
their mothers. Scarcely knowing whither to direct their steps, they fled
toward the Loire, and hastened to place the river between them and their
pursuers. The precaution availed them little. They had barely reached the
vicinity of Châtillon-sur-Loire,<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> when the approach of Cartier with a
detachment of light horse and mounted arquebusiers was announced; and the
defenceless throng, knowing that no pity could be expected from men whose
hands had already been imbrued in the blood of their fellow-believers,
and being exhorted by their ministers to meet death calmly, knelt down
upon the ground and awaited the terrible onset. At that very instant,
between the hillocks in another direction, and somewhat nearer to the
fugitives, a band of cavalry made its appearance. They numbered some one
hundred and twenty men, and, as they rode up, were taken for the advance
guard of their persecutors. But, on coming nearer and recognizing some of
the kneeling suppliants, the knights threw off their cloaks and displayed
their white cassocks, the badge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> adherents of the house of
Navarre. They were two cornets of Huguenot horse, on their way from Berry
to La Charité, under the command of Bourry, Teil, and other captains. In
the midst of the tearful acclamations of the women, their new friends
turned upon the exultant pursuers, and so bravely did they fight that the
Roman Catholics soon fled, leaving eighty men and two standards on the
field. The Huguenot knights, who had so providentially become their
deliverers, escorted the fugitives from Montargis to Sancerre and La
Charité, where they remained in safety until the conclusion of
peace.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Croix de Gastines."</div>

<p>Meantime the courts of justice emulated the example of cruelty set them
by the government and the mob. In May they began by sending to the
gallows on the Place Maubert, in Paris, a student barely twenty-two years
of age, for having taught some children the Huguenot doctrines
(huguenoterie), "without any other crime," the candid chronicler adds.
After so fair a beginning there was no difficulty in finding good
subjects for hanging. Accordingly, on the thirtieth of June, three
victims more were sacrificed on the old Place de Grève, "partly for
heresy and for celebrating the Lord's Supper in their house; partly"&mdash;so
it was pretended&mdash;"for having assisted in demolishing altars." In the
great number of similar executions with which the sanguinary records of
Paris abound, the fate of Nicholas Croquet and the two De
Gastines&mdash;father and son&mdash;would have been forgotten, but for the
extraordinary measures taken in respect to the house where the impiety
had been committed of celebrating the Lord's Supper according to the
simple scheme of its first institution. The Parisian parliament ordered
that "the house of the Five White Crosses, belonging to the De Gastines,
situated in the Rue Saint Denis," should be razed to the ground, and that
upon the site a stone cross should be placed, with an inscription
explanatory of the occasion of its erection. That spot was to serve as a
public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> square for all time, and a fine of 6,000 livres, with corporal
punishment, was imposed upon any one who should ever undertake to build
upon it.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> It was not foreseen that military exigencies might
presently render imperative a reconciliation with the Huguenots, and that
the "perpetual" decree of parliament, like the "irrevocable" edicts of
the king, might be somewhat abridged by stern necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ferocity of parliament against Coligny and others.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A price set on the head of the admiral.</div>

<p>The work of blood continued. In July two noblemen were decapitated&mdash;the
Baron de Laschêne and the Baron de Courtène&mdash;and denunciation of reputed
heretics was vigorously prosecuted, by command of parliament and of the
city curates.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Two months later a cowardly but impotent blow was
struck at a more distinguished personage. Parliament undertook to try
Gaspard de Coligny, and, having found him guilty of treason (on the
thirteenth of September), pronounced him infamous, and offered a reward
of fifty thousand gold crowns for his apprehension, with full pardon for
any offences the captor might have committed. Lest the exploit, however,
should be deemed too difficult for execution, a few days later (on the
twenty-eighth of September) the same liberal terms were held out to any
one who should murder him. As it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> so easy to capture or
assassinate a general who was at that moment in command of an army not
greatly inferior to that of the Duke of Anjou, the court gave the
Parisian populace the cheaper spectacle of a hanging of the admiral in
effigy. It was the eve of the festival of "the Exaltation of the
Cross"&mdash;Tuesday, the thirteenth of September&mdash;and the time was deemed
appropriate for the execution of so determined an enemy of the worship of
that sacred emblem. While Coligny's escutcheon was dragged in dishonor
through the streets by four horses, the hangman amused the mob by giving
to his effigy the traditional tooth-pick, which he was said to be in the
habit of continually using&mdash;a facetious trait which the curate of St.
Barthélemi, of course, does not forget to insert in his brief diary.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>
Nevertheless, that the decree of parliament setting a price upon the
admiral's head was no child's play, appeared about this time from the
abortive plot of one Dominique d'Albe, who confessed that he had been
hired to poison the Huguenot chief, and was hanged by order of the
princes.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Nor was it without practical significance that the decree
itself had been translated into Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, Flemish,
English, and Scotch, and scattered broadcast through Europe by the
partisans of Guise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenots weakened.</div>

<p>Meantime the condition of the rival armies in western France promised
again, in the view of the court, a speedy solution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> military
problem. The Duke of Anjou had of late been heavily reinforced. With the
old troops that had returned to his standard, and the new troops that
poured in upon him, he had a well-appointed army of about twenty-seven
thousand men, of whom one-third were cavalry. Coligny, on the contrary,
had been so weakened by his losses at the siege of Poitiers, and by the
desertion of those whom disappointment at the delays and the expense of
the service had rendered it impossible to retain, that he was inferior to
his antagonist by nine or ten thousand men. He had only eleven or twelve
thousand foot and six thousand horse.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> The Roman Catholic general
resolved to employ his preponderance of forces in striking a decisive
blow. This appeared the more desirable, since it was known that
Montgomery was returning from the reduction of Béarn, bringing with him
six or seven thousand veterans&mdash;an addition to the Huguenot army that
would nearly restore the equilibrium.</p>

<p>Leaving Chinon, where he had been for some time strengthening himself,
the Duke of Anjou crossed the swollen river Vienne, on the twenty-sixth
of September, and started in pursuit of the Huguenots. Coligny had been
resting his army at Faye, a small town about midway between Chinon and
Châtellerault. It was here that the attempt upon his life, to which
allusion has just been made, was discovered. And it was from this point
that the Prince of Orange started in disguise, and undertook, with forty
mounted companions, a perilous journey across France by La Charité to
Montbéliard, for the purpose of raising in Germany the fresh troops of
which the admiral stood in such pressing need.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Moncontour, October 3, 1569.</div>

<p>The Huguenot general had moved westward, secretly averse to giving battle
before the arrival of Montgomery, but forced to show a readiness to fight
by the open impatience of his southern troops, and by the murmurs of the
Germans, who openly threatened to desert unless they were either paid or
led against the enemy. Within a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> leagues of the town of
Moncontour, soon to gain historic renown, Coligny, believing the Roman
Catholics to be near, drew up his own men in order of battle (on the
thirtieth of September); but, receiving from his scouts the erroneous
information that there were no considerable bodies of the enemy in the
neighborhood, he resumed his march toward the town of which La Noue had
rendered himself master. The army was scarcely in motion before Mouy,
commanding the rear, was attacked by a heavy detachment of the Duke of
Anjou's vanguard, under the Duke of Montpensier. Mouy's handful of men
stood their ground well, now facing the enemy and driving him off, now
slowly retreating, and gave the rest of the Huguenot army the opportunity
of gaining the opposite side of a marshy tract, through which there
flowed a small stream. Then they themselves crossed, after losing about a
hundred of their number. Anjou neglected the chance here afforded him of
gaining an entire victory; and Coligny, after halting for a short time,
drew off toward Moncontour, which he reached on the next day without
further obstruction. The duke spent the night on the battle-field in
token of victory, and then started in pursuit; but, in order to avoid
attack while crossing the short, but deep river Dive, a tributary of the
Loire which flows by the walls of Moncontour, he turned to the left, and,
rapidly ascending to its sources, descended again on the opposite bank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny wounded.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Heavy losses of the Huguenots.</div>

<p>The admiral might still have succeeded in avoiding a capital engagement,
and in reaching Partenay or some other point of safety, had he not been
again embarrassed by the mutiny of the Germans, who, as usual, were most
urgent for pay on the eve of battle. As it was, before they could be
quieted, the duke had made up for his considerable détour, and overtook
the Protestants a short distance beyond Moncontour. Coligny, having given
command of the right wing to Count Louis of Nassau, interposed the left,
of which he himself assumed command, between the main body and the enemy,
hoping to get off with a mere skirmish.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> In this he was disappointed.
Attacked in force, his troops made a sturdy resistance. The fight
resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>bled in some of its incidents the conflicts of the paladins of a
past age. The elder rhinegrave rode thirty paces in front of his Roman
Catholic knights; Coligny as far in advance of the Protestants. The two
leaders met in open field. The rhinegrave was killed on the spot. The
admiral received a severe injury in his face. The blood, gushing freely
from the wound, nearly strangled him before his visor could be raised.
Reluctantly he was compelled to retire to the rear of the army. Still the
tide of battle ran high. The Swiss troops of Anjou displayed their
accustomed valor. It was matched by that of the Huguenots, who several
times seemed on the point of winning the day, and already shouted,
"Victory! Victory!" The Duke of Anjou, who, however little he was
entitled to the credit of planning the engagement, certainly displayed
great courage in the contest itself, was at one time in extreme peril,
and the Marquis of Baden was killed while riding near him. On the other
side, the Princes of Béarn and Condé, who had come to the army from
Partenay, to encourage the soldiers by their presence, endeavored by word
and example to sustain the courage of the outnumbered Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> But
at the critical moment, when the Roman Catholic line had begun to give
way, Marshal Cossé, who as yet had not been engaged, advanced with his
fresh troops and changed the fortunes of the day. The personal valor of
Louis of Nassau was unavailing. The German reiters, routed and
panic-stricken, fled from the field. Encountering their own countrymen,
the lansquenets or German infantry, they broke through their ranks and
threw them into confusion. Into the breach thus made the Swiss poured in
an irresistible flood. Inveterate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> hatred now found ample opportunity for
satisfaction. The helpless lansquenets were slaughtered without mercy. No
quarter was given. One of the German colonels, who had been the foremost
cause of the morning's mutiny, and who had prevented his soldiers from
fighting until their wages were paid, now made them tie handkerchiefs to
their pikes to show that they surrendered; but they fared no better than
the rest.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> Others kneeled and begged for mercy of their savage foes,
crying in broken French, "<i>Bon papiste, bon papiste moi!</i>" It was all in
vain. Of four thousand lansquenets that entered the action, barely two
hundred escaped with their lives. Three thousand French, enveloped by
Anjou's cavalry, were spared by the duke's express command, but not
before one thousand of their companions had been killed. In all, two
thousand French foot soldiers and three hundred knights perished on the
field, while with the valets and camp-followers the loss was much more
considerable. La Noue was again a prisoner in the enemy's hands. So also
was the famous D'Acier. His captor, Count Santa Fiore, received from Pius
the Fifth a severe letter of rebuke for "having failed to obey his
commands <i>to slay at once every heretic that fell into his hands</i>."<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>The battle of Moncontour, fought on Monday, the third of October, 1569,
was a thorough success on the side of the Guises and of Catharine de'
Medici. Compared with it, the battle of Jarnac was only an insignificant
skirmish. Although, under the skilful conduct of Louis of Nassau and of
Wolrad of Mans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>feld, the remnants of the army drew off to Airvault and
thence to Partenay, escaping the pursuit of Aumale and Biron, the
Huguenot losses were enormous, and the spirit of the soldiers was, for
the time, entirely crushed.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> The Roman Catholics, on the contrary,
had lost scarcely any infantry, and barely five hundred horse, although
among the cavalry officers were several persons of great distinction.</p>

<p>Fame magnified the exploit, and exalted the Duke of Anjou into a hero.
Charles himself became still more jealous of his brother's growing
reputation. Pius the Fifth, on receipt of the tidings, sent the latter a
brief, congratulating him upon his success, renewing his advice to make
thorough work of exterminating the heretics, and warning him against a
mercy than which there was nothing more cruel.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> To foreign
courts&mdash;especially to those which betrayed a leaning to the Protestant
side&mdash;the most exaggerated accounts of the victory were despatched. A
"relation" of the battle of Moncontour, with which Philip the Second was
furnished, stated the Huguenot loss at fifteen thousand men, eleven
cannon, three thousand wagons belonging to the reiters, and eight hundred
or nine hundred horses.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> For a moment the court believed that the

<div class="sidenote">The assassin rewarded with the collar of the order.</div>

<p>The Roman Catholics were, nevertheless, entirely mistaken in their
anticipations of the speedy subjugation of their opponents. The latter
were disheartened for a few days, but not in the least disposed to give
over the struggle. "The reformed were too numerous," a modern historian
well remarks, "too well organized, and had struck their roots too deeply,
to be subdued by the loss of a few pitched battles."<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> The prospect at
first was, indeed, very dark. It seemed almost impossible for the
Huguenots to maintain themselves in the region which for a whole year had
been the chief field of operations. As Anjou advanced southward, Partenay
was abandoned without a blow, and after occupying it he pushed on toward
Niort. Of this important place the intrepid De Mouy had been placed by
Coligny in command. Not content with a bare defence, he sallied out and
repulsed the enemy. But his boldness proved fatal to him. There was a
Roman Catholic "gentilhomme," Maurevel by name, who, allured by the
reward of fifty thousand crowns offered by parliament for the capture or
assassination of Admiral Coligny, had entered the Protestant camp with
protestations of great disgust with his former patrons the Guises, and
had vainly sought an opportu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>nity to take the great chieftain's life.
Three years later that opportunity was to present itself in the streets
of Paris itself. Loth to return to his friends without accomplishing any
noteworthy exploit, Maurevel joined De Mouy, with whom he so ingratiated
himself that the general not only supplied him from his purse, but made
him a companion and a bed-fellow. As the Huguenots were returning to
Niort, the traitor found the conjuncture he desired. Chancing to be left
alone with De Mouy, he drew a pistol and shot him in the loins; then
putting spurs to his horse, reached with ease the advancing columns of
Anjou. De Mouy was taken back to Niort mortally wounded. His friends,
contrary to his earnest desire, insisted on taking him by boat down the
Sèvre to La Rochelle, where he died. Meanwhile Niort, in discouragement,
surrendered to the Roman Catholic army.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The assassin was well
rewarded. A letter is extant, written by Charles the Ninth to the Duke of
Anjou, from Plessis-lez-Tours, on the tenth of October, 1569, in which
the king begs his brother to confer on "Charles de Louvier, sieur de
Moureveil, being the person who killed Mouy," the collar of the royal
order of Saint Michael, to which he had been elected by the knights
companions, as a reward for "his signal service;" and to see that he
receive from the city of Paris a present commensurate with his
merits!<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fatal error of the court.</div>

<p>Catharine de' Medici and the Cardinal of Lorraine came from Tours, where
they had been watching the course of the war, Niort, and the plan of
future operations was discussed in their presence. Almost every place of
importance previously held by the Huguenots toward the north and east of
La Rochelle had fallen, even to the almost impregnable Lusig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>nan. Saint
Jean d'Angely, on the Boutonne, was the only remaining outwork, whose
capture must precede an attack on the citadel itself. Should the
victorious army of the king lay siege to Saint Jean d'Angely, or should
it continue the pursuit of Coligny and the princes, who, in order to
divert it from the undertaking, had retired from Saint Jean d'Angely to
Saintes, and thence, not long after, in the direction of Montauban? This
was the question that demanded an instant answer. Jean de Serres informs
us that the Protestant leaders were extremely anxious that their enemies
should adopt the latter course;<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> yet the best military authorities on
both sides declare without hesitation that the failure of the Roman
Catholics to follow it was the one capital error that saved the
Huguenots, perhaps, from utter destruction. "Hundreds of times have I
been amazed," says the Roman Catholic Blaise de Montluc, "that so many
great and wise captains who were with Monsieur (the Duke of Anjou) should
have adopted the bad plan of laying sieges, instead of pursuing the
princes, who were routed and reduced to such extremities that they had no
means of getting to their feet again." And the Protestant François de la
Noue devotes an entire chapter of his "discourses" to the proof of the
assertion that "as the siege of Poitiers was the beginning of the mishaps
of the Huguenots, so that of Saint Jean was the means of arresting the
good fortune of the Catholics."</p>

<p>What, it may be asked, led to the commission of so fatal an error? The
memoirs of Tavannes, who advocated the immediate pursuit of the admiral,
ascribe it to the reluctance of the Montmorencies to permit their cousin
to be overwhelmed; to the jealousy felt by Cardinal Lorraine of the
military successes which threw his brother, the Duke of Aumale, and his
nephew, the Duke of Guise, into obscurity; and to the suggestions of De
Retz, the king's favorite, who persuaded Charles that it was dangerous to
permit the renown of Anjou to increase yet further.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> It must,
however, be remembered that the younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> Tavannes is not always a good
authority; and that where, as in the present instance, the glory of his
father is affected, he becomes altogether untrustworthy. If we reject his
account as apocryphal, which apparently we must do, there still remains
good reason to believe that the siege of Saint Jean d'Angely was agreed
to by the majority of the Roman Catholic leaders from the sincere
conviction that its reduction, to be followed by the still more important
capture of La Rochelle, would annihilate the Huguenot party in the west,
its stronghold and refuge, and that it could then subsist but little
longer in other parts of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of Saint Jean d'Angely.</div>

<p>The defence of Saint Jean d'Angely had been intrusted by Coligny to
competent hands. De Piles had found the fortifications weak and
imperfect; he completed and strengthened them.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> With a small garrison
of Huguenots he repaired by night the breaches made by the enemy's cannon
during the day, and repelled every attempt to storm the place. When the
siege had advanced about two weeks, Charles himself, who was resolved not
to suffer Henry of Anjou any longer to win all the laurels of the war,
made his appearance in the Roman Catholic camp, on the twenty-sixth of
October, and summoned the garrison to surrender. De Piles, however,
declined to listen to the commands of the king, even as he had disobeyed
those of the duke, taking refuge in the feudal theory that he could give
up the place only to the Prince of Navarre, the royal governor of the
province of Guyenne, at whose hands he had received it. Yet the position
of the Protestants was growing extremely perilous. During one of the
assaults upon the wall, De Piles himself became so thoroughly convinced
that Saint Jean would be carried, that he caused a breach to be made in
the fortifications in his rear, in order to facilitate the withdrawal of
his troops. Happily, he had no need of this mode of escape on the present
occasion. Meanwhile the most honorable terms were offered him. These he
refused to accept; but, finding his stock of ammunition rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> becoming
exhausted, he agreed to a truce of ten days, that he might have time to
send a messenger to the princes to obtain their orders; promising, in
case he received no succor in the interval, to surrender the city on
condition that the garrison should be permitted to retire with their
horses, arms and personal effects, and that religious liberty should be
granted to all the residents. But, before the armistice had quite
expired, Saint Surin, and forty other brave horsemen from Angoulême,
succeeded in piercing the enemy's lines, and relieved De Piles from an
engagement into which he had entered with great reluctance. The hostages
on both sides were given up, and the siege was renewed with greater fury
than ever. In the end, seeing no prospect of sufficient reinforcement to
enable him to maintain his position, De Piles capitulated (on the second
of December) on similar terms to those that he had before declined, and
the garrison marched out with flying banners. Seven weeks had they
detained the entire army of the victors of Moncontour before an
ill-fortified place. More than six thousand men had died under its walls,
by the casualties of war and by the scarcely less destructive diseases
that raged in the camp.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> One of the ablest and most enterprising of
the royal generals&mdash;Sebastian of Luxemburg, Viscount of Martigues and
governor of Brittany&mdash;had been killed.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> Of the Protestants, only
about a hundred and eighty persons perished, nearly the half of them
inhabitants of the town; for the men of Saint Jean d'Angely, and even
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> women and children, had labored industriously in defending their
firesides.</p>

<p>It was a part of the compact, that, while neither De Piles nor his
soldiers should serve on the Huguenot side for four months, they should
be safely conducted without the Roman Catholic lines. The Duc d'Aumale
and other leaders seem to have endeavored conscientiously to execute the
stipulation; but their followers could not resist the temptation to
attack the Huguenots as they were traversing the suburbs. Nearly all were
robbed, and a considerable number&mdash;as many, according to Agrippa
d'Aubigné, as fell during the siege&mdash;were murdered. De Piles, on his
arrival at Angoulême, wrote to demand the punishment of those who had
committed so flagrant a breach of faith, and, when he could obtain no
satisfaction, sent a herald to the king to declare that he held himself
and his fellow-combatants absolved from all obligations, and that they
would at once resume their places in the Huguenot army.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>Nearly three months of precious time elapsed since the disastrous rout of
Moncontour before the royalists completed the reduction of the region
adjoining La Rochelle. Outside of that citadel of French Protestantism
only the little town of Tonnay, on the Charente, still held for the
Prince of Navarre. Yet so long as La Rochelle itself stood firm, the Duke
of Anjou had accomplished little; and La Rochelle had made good use of
the respite to strengthen its works. Every effort to gain a lodgement in
its neighborhood had signally failed. The end of December came, and with
it cold and discouragement. Anjou's army was dwindling away. The King of
Spain and the Pope recalled their troops, as if the battle of the third
of October had ended the war, and Santa Fiore, the pontifical general,
sent to Rome twenty-six standards, taken by the Italians at Moncontour&mdash;a
present from Charles the Ninth, which Pius accepted with great delight,
and dedicated as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> trophy in the Basilica of St. John Lateran.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Henry of Anjou himself was ill, or was unwilling any longer to endure
separation from a court of whose pleasures he was inordinately fond; and,
resigning the command of the army into the hands of the eldest son of the
Duke of Montpensier, François de Bourbon&mdash;generally known as the prince
dauphin&mdash;he hastened, at the beginning of the new year, to join Charles
and Catharine de' Medici at Angers. The French troops, meantime, were
either furloughed or scattered, and the generals condemned to inaction,
while the German reiters and lansquenets and the Swiss pikemen were
permitted to return to their own homes.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Such was the suicidal policy
of the Roman Catholic party&mdash;a policy which saved the Huguenots from
prostration; for it may with truth be affirmed that the errors committed
in the siege of Saint Jean d'Angely, and in disbanding the powerful army
of Anjou, completely obliterated the advantage which had been won on the
bloody field of Moncontour.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>While the Protestants had been forced to abandon one important place
after another in Poitou, Saintonge and Aunis, they had in other parts of
the kingdom been displaying their old enterprise, and had obtained
considerable success. Vézelay in Burgundy, the birthplace of the reformer
Theodore Beza, passed through a fiery ordeal. This ancient town, built
upon the brow of a hill, and strong as well by reason of its situation as
of its walls constructed in a style that was now becoming obsolete in
France, had been captured at the beginning of the war by some of the
neighboring Huguenot noblemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> who scaled the walls and surprised the
garrison. One of the few points the Protestants held in the eastern part
of the kingdom, it was regarded as a place of the greatest importance to
their cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot successes. Vézelay.</div>

<p>Within a few weeks Vézelay was twice besieged by a Roman Catholic army
under Sansac. A vigorous sortie, in which the Huguenots destroyed almost
all the engines of war of the assailants, on the first occasion caused
the siege to be raised. When Sansac renewed his attempt he fared no
better. The soldiers who had thrown themselves into the place, with the
enthusiastic citizens, repelled every attack, and promptly suppressed
treacherous plots by putting to death two persons whom they found engaged
in revealing their secrets to the enemy. Sansac next undertook to reduce
Vézelay by hunger; but the Huguenots broke his lines, aided by their
friends in La Charité and Sancerre, and supplied themselves abundantly
with provisions. When, on the sixteenth of December, Sansac finally
abandoned the fruitless and inglorious undertaking, he had lost, since
October, no fewer than fifteen hundred of his soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Brilliant capture of Nismes.</div>

<p>The Huguenots of Sancerre in turn made an attempt to enter Bourges, the
capital of the province of Berry, by promising a large sum of money to
the officer second in command of the citadel; but he revealed their plan
to his superior, M. de la Chastre, governor of the province, and the
advanced party which had been admitted within the gates (on the
twenty-first of December) fell into the snare prepared for them.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The
capture of Nismes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>&mdash;"the city of antiquities"&mdash;more than compensated for
the failure at Bourges. Rarely has an enterprise of equal difficulty been
more patiently prosecuted, or been crowned with more brilliant success.
The exiled Protestants, a large and important class, had now for many
months been subjected to the greatest hardships, and were anxiously
watching an opportunity to return to their homes. At last a carpenter
presented himself, who had long revolved the matter in his mind, and had
discovered a method of introducing the Huguenots into the city which
promised well. There was a fountain, a short distance from the walls of
Nismes, known to the ancients by the same name as the city
itself&mdash;Nemausus&mdash;whose copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> stream, put to good service by the
inhabitants, turned a number of mills within the municipal limits. To
admit the waters a canal had been built, which, where it pierced the
fortifications, was protected by a heavy iron grating. Through this wet
channel the carpenter resolved that the Huguenots should enter Nismes. It
so happened that a friend of his dwelt in a house which was close to the
wall at this spot; with his help he lowered himself by night from a
window into the ditch. A cord, which was slackened or drawn tight
according as there was danger of detection or apparent security, served
to direct his operations. The utmost caution was requisite, and the
water-course was too contracted to permit more than a single person to
work at once. Provided only with a file, the carpenter set himself to
sever the stout iron bars. The task was neither pleasant nor easy. Night
after night he stood in the cold stream, with the mud up to his knees,
exposed to wind and rain, and working most industriously when the roar of
the elements covered and drowned the noise he made. It was only for a few
minutes at a time that he could work; for, as the place was situated
between the citadel and the "porte des Carmes," a sentry passed it at
brief intervals, and was scarcely out of hearing except when he went to
ring the bell which announced a change of guard. Fifteen nights, chosen
from the darkest of the season, were consumed in this perilous
undertaking; and each morning, when the approach of dawn compelled him to
suspend his labors, the carpenter concealed his progress by means of wax
and mud. All this time he had been prudent enough to keep his own
counsel; but when, on the fifteenth of November, his work was completed,
he called upon the Huguenot leaders to follow him into Nismes. A
detachment of three hundred men was placed at his disposal. When once the
foremost were in the town, and had overpowered the neighboring guards,
the Huguenots obtained an easy success. The clatter of a number of
camp-servants, who were mounted on horseback, with orders to ride in
every direction, shouting that the city was in the hands of the enemy,
contributed to facilitate the capture. Most of the soldiers, who should
have met and repelled the Protestants, shut themselves up in their houses
and refused to leave them. In a few minutes, all Nismes, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> the
exception of the castle, which held out a few months longer, was
taken.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny encouraged.</div>

<p>When Admiral Coligny, wounded and defeated, was borne on a litter from
the field of Moncontour, where the hopes of the Huguenots had been so
rudely dashed to the ground, his heart almost failed him in view of the
prospects of the war and of his faith. Two persons seemed at this
critical juncture to have exercised on his mind a singular influence in
restoring him to his accustomed hopefulness. L'Estrange, a simple
gentleman, was being carried away in a plight similar to his own, when,
having been brought to the admiral's side, he looked intently upon him,
and then gave expression to his gratitude to Heaven, that, in the midst
of the chastisements with which it had seen fit to visit his
fellow-believers, there was yet so much of mercy shown, in the words,
"Yet is God very gentle!"<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>&mdash;a friendly reminder, which, the great
leader was wont to say, raised him from gloom and turned his thoughts to
high and noble resolve.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Nor was the heroic Queen of Navarre found
wanting at this crisis. No sooner had she heard of the disaster than she
started from La Rochelle, and at Niort met the admiral, with such
remnants of the army as still clung to him. Far from yielding to
despondency, Jeanne d'Albret urged the generals to renew the contest;
and, having communicated to them a part of her own enthusiasm, returned
to La Rochelle to watch over the defence of the city, and to lend still
more important assistance to the cause, by writing to Queen Elizabeth and
the other allies of the Huguenots, correcting the exaggerated accounts of
the defeat of Moncontour which had been studiously disseminated by the
Roman Catholic party, and imploring fresh assistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Withdrawal of the troops of Dauphiny and Provence.</div>

<p>As for Coligny, his plans were soon formed. The troops of Dauphiny and
Provence, always among the most reluctant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> leave their homes, had long
been clamoring for permission to return. It was now impossible to retain
them. On the fourteenth of October they started from Angoulême, whither
they had gone without consulting the Protestant generals, and, under the
leadership of Montbrun and Mirabel, directed their course toward their
native provinces. In two days they reached the river Dordogne at
Souillac, where a part of their body, while seeking to cross, was
attacked by the Roman Catholics, and suffered great loss. The rest pushed
forward to Aurillac, in Auvergne, which had recently been captured by a
Huguenot captain, and soon found their way to Privas, Aubenas, and the
banks of the Rhône.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Thence, after refreshing themselves for a few
days, they crossed into Dauphiny to renew the struggle for their own
firesides.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan of the admiral's bold march.</div>

<p>On the eighteenth of October, four days after the departure of the
Dauphinese troops from Angoulême, Coligny set forth from Saintes upon an
expedition as remarkable for boldness of conception as for its singularly
skilful and successful execution&mdash;an expedition which is entitled to rank
among the most remarkable military operations of modern times.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> In
the face of an enemy flushed with victory, and himself leading an army
reduced to the mere shadow of its former size, the admiral deliberately
drew up the plan of a march of eight or nine months, through a hostile
territory, and terminating in the vicinity of the capital itself. As
sketched by Michel de Castelnau from the admiral's own words in
conversation with him, the objects of the Protestant general were
principally these: to satisfy the claims of his mutinous German
mercenaries by the reduction of some of the enemy's rich cities in
Guyenne; to strengthen himself by forming a junction with the army of
Montgomery and such fresh troops as "the viscounts" might be able to
raise; to meet on the lower Rhône the recruited forces of Montbrun and
Mirabel; thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> to turn northward, and, having reached the borders of
Lorraine, to welcome the Germans whom the Elector Palatine and William of
Orange would hold in readiness; and, at last, to bring the war to an end
by forcing the Roman Catholics to give battle, under circumstances more
advantageous to the reformed, in the immediate vicinity of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He sweeps through Guyenne.</div>

three thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> The young Princes of Navarre and of Condé, whom
he wished to accustom to the fatigues of the march and of the
battle-field, while endearing them to the Huguenots by their
participation in the same perils with the meanest private soldier, were
his companions, and had commands of their own. He had left La
Rochefoucauld in La Rochelle to protect the city and the Queen of
Navarre. The admiral's course was first directed to Montauban, that city
which has been the stronghold of Protestantism in southern France down to
the present time. But the difficulties of the way, and, particularly, the
improbability of finding easy means of crossing so near their mouths the
successive rivers, which, rising in the mountainous region of Auvergne
and the Cevennes, all flow westward and empty into the Garonne, or its
wide estuary, the Gironde, compelled Coligny to make a considerable
deflection to the left. He effected the passage of the Dordogne at
Argentat, a little above the spot where Montbrun had sustained his recent
check, and, after making a feint of throwing himself into Auvergne,
crossed the Lot below Cadenac, and reached Montauban in safety.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> The
Count of Montgomery, returning from his victorious campaign in Béarn, had
been ordered to be in readiness in this city. But learning that, by an
unaccountable delay, he was still in Condom, south of the Garonne,
Coligny marched westward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> Aiguillon, at the confluence of the Lot and
the Garonne. Near this place he constructed, with great trouble, a
substantial bridge across the Garonne, with the intention of transporting
his army to the left bank, and ravaging the country far down in the
direction of Bordeaux. This bold movement was prevented by Blaise de
Montluc, who, adopting the suggestion of another, and appropriating the
credit due to the sagacity of this nameless genius, detached one of the
numerous floating windmills that were moored in the Garonne, and having
loaded it with stones, sent it down with the current against Coligny's
bridge. Not only were the chains that bound the structure broken, but the
very boats on which it rested were carried away as far as to Bordeaux
itself. It was with great difficulty that the admiral brought back to the
right bank the division of his army that had already crossed, and with it
the troops of Count Montgomery.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>The united army now returned to Montauban, where, in the midst of a rich
district in part friendly to the Huguenots, it spent the last days of
1569 and the greater part of the month of January, 1570. Its numbers had
by this time received such large accessions, that Coligny wrote to
Germany that he had six or seven thousand horse and fifteen thousand
foot.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> As the reformed population of Montauban had contributed enough

cause, and pushed their raids under the intrepid La Loue south of the
Garonne toward the Bay of Biscay, as far as Mont de Marsan and Roquefort
in the "Pays des Landes."<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">"Vengeance de Rapin."</div>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny pushes on to the Rhône.</div>

<p>The Huguenots now proceeded towards Toulouse, but that city was too
strongly fortified and garrisoned to tempt them to make an attack. They
inflicted, however, a stern retribution upon the vicinity, devoting to
destruction the villas and pleasure-grounds of the members of a
parliament that had rendered itself infamous for its injustice and blind
bigotry. The cruel fate of Rapin, murdered according to the forms of law,
simply because he was a Protestant and brought from the king an edict
containing too much toleration to suit the inordinate orthodoxy of these
robed fanatics, was yet fresh in the memory of the soldiers, and fired
their blood. On ruined and blackened walls, in more than one quarter,
could be read subsequently the ominous words, written by no idle
braggarts: "<i>Vengeance de Rapin!</i>" Leaving the marks of their passage in
a desolated district, the Huguenots swept on to the friendly city of
Castres, and thence through lower Languedoc, by Carcassonne and
Montpellier, which they made no attempt to reduce, to Uzès and Nismes.
Meanwhile Piles had from Castres made a marauding expedition with a body
of picked troops to the very foot of the Pyrenees, and, in retaliation
for the aid which the Spaniards had furnished Charles the Ninth, had
penetrated to Perpignan, and ravaged the County of Roussillon.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His singular success and its causes.</div>

<p>Thus the Huguenots&mdash;of whom Charles had contemptuously written to his
ambassador at London, in January, that they were in so miserable a plight
that, even since Anjou had dismissed all his men-at-arms after the
capture of Saint Jean d'Angely, they dared not show their
faces<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> pushed an army from the mouth of the Gironde to the
mouth of the Rhône. If Viscount Monclar had fallen mortally wounded near
Castres, and brave La Loue had been surprised and killed near
Montpellier, the Protestants had, nevertheless, sustained little injury.
They had been largely reinforced on the way, both by the local troops
that joined them and by chivalric spirits such as M. de Piles, who
followed them so soon as he was forced to surrender Saint Jean d'Angely;
or, like Beaudiné and Renty, who had been left with La Rochefoucauld to
guard La Rochelle, but who, impatient of long inaction, at length
obtained permission to attach themselves to the princes, and caught up
with them at Castres, after a journey full of hazardous adventures. The
Huguenot army, says La Noue, had been but an insignificant snow-ball when
it started on its adventurous course; but the imprudence of its opponents
permitted it to roll on, without hinderance, until it grew to a
portentous size.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> The jealousy existing between Montluc and Marshal
Damville, who commanded for the king&mdash;the former as lieutenant-general in
Gascony, and the latter as governor in Languedoc&mdash;undoubtedly removed
many difficulties from the way of Admiral Coligny; and Montluc openly
accused his rival, who was a Montmorency, of purposely furthering the
designs of his heretical cousin. The accusation was a baseless
fabrication; yet it obtained, as such stories generally do, a wide
currency among the prejudiced and the ignorant, who could explain
Damville's failure to impede Coligny's progress in no more satisfactory
way than as the result of collusion between the son and the nephew of the
late constable.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The admiral turns toward Paris.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His illness interrupts negotiations.</div>

<p>Coligny had not yet accomplished his main object. Turning northward, and
hugging the right bank of the Rhône, he prosecuted his undertaking of
carrying the war to the very gates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> Paris. The few small pieces of
artillery the Protestants possessed, it was now found difficult to drag
over rugged hills that descended to the river's edge. They were,
therefore, at first transported to the other side, and finally left
behind in some castles garrisoned by the Huguenots. The recruits that had
been expected from Dauphiny came in very small numbers, and it was with
diminished forces that Coligny and the princes, on the twenty-sixth of
May, reached Saint Étienne, at that time a small town, which modern
enterprise and capital has transformed into a great manufacturing
city.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> A little farther, at St. Rambert on the Loire, an incident
occurred which threatened to blight all the fair hopes the Protestants
had now again begun to conceive of a speedy and prosperous conclusion of
the war. Admiral Coligny fell dangerously ill, and for a time serious
fears were entertained for his life. It was a moment of anxious suspense.
Never before had the reformed realized the extent to which their fortunes
were dependent on a single man. The lesson was a useful one to the young
companions of the princes, who, in the midst of the stern discipline of
the camp, had shown some disposition to complain of the loss of the more
congenial gayety of the court.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Louis of Nassau, brother of William
of Orange, and next in command, was the only person among the Protestants
that could have succeeded to Coligny in his responsible position; but
even Louis of Nassau could not exact the respect enjoyed by the admiral,
both with his own troops and with the enemy. Indeed, it was the conduct
of the Roman Catholics at this juncture that furnished the clearest proof
of the indispensable importance to the Huguenots of their veteran leader.
The negotiations, which must soon be adverted to, had for some time been
in progress, and the court displayed considerable anxiety to secure a
peace; but the moment it was announced that Coligny was likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> die,
the deputies from the king broke them off and waited to see the issue.
Being asked to explain so singular a course, and being reminded that the
Huguenots had other generals with whom a treaty might be formed in case
of Coligny's death, it is said that the deputies replied by expressing
their surprise that the Protestants did not see the weight and authority
possessed by their admiral. "Were he to die to-day," said they,
"to-morrow we should not offer you so much as a glass of water. As if you
did not know that the admiral's name goes farther in giving you
consideration than had you another army equal in size to that you have at
present!"<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Engagement of Arnay-le-Duc.</div>

<p>But Gaspard de Coligny was destined to die a death more glorious for
himself, and to leave behind him a name more illustrious than it would
have been had he died on the eve of the return of peace to his desolated
country. He recovered, and once more advanced with his brave Huguenots.
And now the distance between the Protestant camp and the Roman Catholic
capital was rapidly diminishing. To meet the impending danger, the king
ordered Marshal Cossé, who had succeeded the prince dauphin in command of
the new army, to cross into Burgundy, check the admiral's course, and, if
possible, defeat him. The two armies met on the twenty-fifth of June, in
the neighborhood of the small town of Arnay-le-Duc.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> Great was the
disparity of numbers. Cossé had four thousand Swiss, six thousand French
infantry, three thousand French, German, and Italian horse, and twelve
cannon. Coligny's army had lost so much during its incessant marches
through a thousand difficult places, and in a country where desertion or
straying from the main body was so easy, that it consisted of but
twenty-five hundred arquebusiers and two thousand horsemen, besides a few
recruits from Dauphiny.</p>

<p>The Germans, who constituted about one-half of the cavalry, were
ill-equipped; but the French horse were as well armed as any corps the
Huguenots had been able to set on foot. All were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> hardened by toil and
well disciplined. Of artillery the admiral was entirely destitute.</p>

<p>The armies took position upon opposite hills, separated by a narrow
valley, in which flowed a brook fed by some small ponds. Cossé made the
attack, and attempted to cross the stream; but, after an obstinate fight
of seven hours, his troops were compelled to abandon the undertaking with
considerable loss. Next the entrenchments thrown up by the Huguenots in
the neighborhood of the ponds were assaulted. Here the Roman Catholics
were subjected to a galling fire, and began to yield. Afterward,
receiving reinforcements, they seemed to be on the point of succeeding,
when Coligny brought up M. de Piles, the hero of Saint Jean d'Angely,
who, supported by Count Montgomery, soon restored the superiority of the
Huguenots. The enemy was equally unfortunate in the attempt,
simultaneously made, to turn the admiral's position; and, foiled at every
point, he retired for the day. On the morrow, both armies reappeared in
the same order of battle, but neither general was eager to renew a
contest in which the advantage was all with those who stood on the
defensive, and, after indulging in a brief and ineffective cannonade, the
order was given to the Roman Catholic troops to return to camp.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny approaches Paris.</div>

<p>After this indecisive combat, Coligny, who had no desire to bring on a
general engagement before receiving the considerable accession of troops
of which he was in expectation, slipped away from Cossé, and though hotly
pursued by the enemy's cavalry, made his way to the friendly walls of La
Charité upon the Loire. Here he busied himself with preparations for
further undertakings, and was engaged particularly in providing his army
with a few cannon and mortars, of which he had greatly felt the need,
when activity was interrupted by a ten days' truce, dating from the
fourteenth of July, the precursor of a definite treaty of peace.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> At
the expiration of the armistice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> Coligny advanced, toward the end of
July, to his castle of Châtillon-sur-Loing, and distributed his troops in
the vicinity of Montargis, still nearer Paris. Marshal Cossé, at the same
time, moved in a parallel line through Joigny, and took up his position
at Sens, where he could at once protect the capital and prevent the
Huguenots from making raids in that fertile and populous province, the
"Île de France," from which the whole country had derived its name.
Leaving the admiral and his brave followers here, at the conclusion of an
adventurous expedition of over twelve hundred miles, which had consumed
more than nine months, let us glance at the negotiations for peace which
had long been in progress, and were now at length crowned with success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the negotiations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The English rebellion affects the terms offered.</div>

<p>So true was it of the combatants in the French civil wars, that they
rarely carried on hostilities but they were also treating for peace, that
since the battle of Moncontour there had hardly elapsed a month without
the discussion of the terms on which arms could be laid aside by both
parties. Scarcely had the first startling impression made by the defeat
of the Huguenots passed away before Catharine de' Medici sent that
skilful diplomatist, Michel de Castelnau, to assure the Queen of Navarre,
at La Rochelle, of her personal esteem and affection, as well as of her
fervent desire to employ her influence with the king, her son, in
effecting a pacification based upon just and honorable conditions. Jeanne
replied in courteous language; but, while she insisted upon her own
hearty reciprocation of the queen mother's wish, she also expressed the
suspicion which all the reformed entertained of the sincerity of the
leading ministers in the French cabinet, whose relations with Spain and
with the Pope showed that they were intent on nothing less than the utter
ruin of the Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> In November the matter took a more definite
shape, through Marshal Cossé, who appeared in La Rochelle with
propositions of peace. This statesman, otherwise moderate in his
counsels, was imbued with the notion that the Protestants were so
discouraged by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> their late defeat, that they would gladly accept any
terms. But the Huguenots, having understood that he was empowered merely
to offer them liberty of conscience, without the right to the public
worship of God, promptly broke off the negotiations.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> A month or two
later they were induced to believe that the court was disposed to larger
concessions, or, if not, that they might at least justify themselves in
the eyes of the world by showing that they were neither unreasonable nor
desirous of prolonging the horrors of war. Two deputies&mdash;Jean de la Fin,
Sieur de Beauvoir la Nocle, and Charles de Téligny: the one sent by the
Queen of Navarre, the other sent by Coligny and the princes, who were
already far on their journey through the south of France&mdash;came to the
king at Angers, and presented the demands of the Huguenots. These demands
certainly did not breathe a spirit of craven submission. The Huguenots
called not only for complete liberty of conscience, but also for the
right to hold their religious assemblies through the entire kingdom,
without prejudice to their dignities or honors. They stipulated for the
annulling of all sentences pronounced against them; the approval of all
that they had done, as done for the welfare of the realm; the restitution
of their dignities and property, and the giving of good and sufficient
securities for the execution of the edict of pacification.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Catharine
and her counsellors had undoubtedly gained some wholesome experience
since Cossé's first proposals. They had already discovered that a single
pitched battle had not ruined the Huguenots; and they now suspected that
a number of additional battles might be required to effect that desirable
result. It is not astonishing, however, that the queen mother was not yet
ready to grant terms which could scarcely have been conceded even on the
morrow of an overwhelming defeat. The articles sent by the king to the
Protestant leaders as a counter-proposal were therefore of a very
different character from those which they had submitted. Charles offered
to the Queen of Navarre, the Princes of Navarre and Condé, the admiral,
and their followers, entire amnesty, and consented to annul all judicial
proceedings made against them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> during these or the late troubles. He
would exact no punishment for any treaties which they might have formed
with foreign princes, and would restore their goods, honors, and estates.
As to the religious question, he would allow them to hold two cities, in
which they might do as they pleased, the king placing in each city a
capable "gentilhomme" to maintain his authority and the public
tranquillity. Elsewhere in France he would tolerate no reformed minister,
no exercise of any other religion than his own. Neither would he
guarantee the restitution of the judicial and other offices once held by
Protestants, since others had bought them, and the money proceeding from
the sale had been spent in defraying the expenses of the war; especially
as the clergy must look to the courts for the enforcement of their claims
for indemnification for the destruction of the churches and other
ecclesiastical property. The king professed himself willing to give all
reasonable securities for the performance of his promises, but neglected
to make any specification of the nature of those securities.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Such
were the hard conditions offered&mdash;all that Catharine and the Guises were
willing to concede at a time when it was hoped that the Huguenots would
lose the assistance of one of their secret supporters, Elizabeth of
England; for the Earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland had risen in
the north, and they had not only the best wishes, but the ready
co-operation of every Spanish and French sympathizer. Charles himself was
writing to his ambassador at London a letter meant to meet the queen's
eye, instructing him to congratulate Elizabeth on the progress made in
suppressing the insurrection; and Catharine, by the same messenger, sent
a secret letter of the same date, ordering the same diplomatic agent, in
case the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>bellion was not at an end, to give aid and comfort to the
rebels.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> Catharine and the Guises had not lost heart. Moved by
repeated supplications, Pius the Fifth at last decided to excommunicate
the heretical daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn. But, as the bull of the
twenty-fifth of February, 1570, had been procured solely by the
entreaties of the rebel earls, enforced by the intercessions of the
Guises, and as it was known that Philip the Second, so far from desiring
it, was strongly opposed to the imprudent policy of the pontiff, the
document, which pretended to relieve all the queen's subjects of the
obligations of their allegiance, was committed to the charge of the
Cardinal of Lorraine, to launch at Elizabeth's devoted head whenever the
convenient moment should arrive.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>At Montréal, near Carcassonne, the admiral was again overtaken by a royal
messenger, who on this occasion was Biron, equally distinguished on the
field and in the council-chamber. While the Protestants replied to his
offer that with heartfelt satisfaction they greeted the king's
disposition to restore peace to France, and sent to Charles, who was then
at Châteaubriand, in Brittany, a delegation consisting of Téligny,
Beauvoir la Nocle, and La Chassetière, they distinctly stated that no
terms could be entertained which should not include liberty of worship.
For they declared that "the deprivation of the exercise of their religion
was more insupportable to them than death itself."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> But, in fact, the
Huguenot princes and nobles placed little reliance upon the sincerity of
the court, and had no hope of peace so long as they treated at a distance
from the capital. Accordingly, Coligny, in his march up the valley of the
Rhône, when again approached in the king's name by Biron, accompanied by
Henry de Mesmes, Sieur de Malassise, peremptorily declined to enter into
a truce which should interrupt the efficiency of his movement.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The war fruitless for its authors.</div>

<p>But when at last the admiral reached the Loire, and, at La Charité and
Châtillon, was within a few hours of Paris, the attitude of the court in
relation to the peace seemed to undergo an entire change, and it became
evident that the negotiations, which had previously been employed for the
mere purpose of amusing the Huguenots, were now resorted to with the view
of ending a war already protracted far beyond expectation. Nor is it
difficult to discover some of the circumstances that tended to bring
about this radical mutation of policy.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> The resources of the kingdom
were exhausted. It was no longer possible to furnish the ready money
without which the German and other mercenaries, of late constituting a
large portion of the royal troops, could not be induced to enter the
kingdom. The Pope and Philip were lavish of nothing beyond promises and
exhortations that above all things Charles should make no peace with the
heretical rebels. Indeed, Philip had few men, and no money, to spare. The
French troops were in great straits. The gentlemen, who, in return for
their immunity from all taxation, were bound to serve the monarch in the
field at their own expense, had exhausted their available funds in so
long a contest, and it was impossible to muster them in such numbers as
the war demanded. Charles himself had always been averse to war. His
tastes were pacific. If he ever emulated the martial glory which his
brother Anjou had so easily acquired, the feeling was but of momentary
duration, and met with little encouragement from his mother. He had,
undoubtedly, consented to the initiation of the war only in consequence
of the misrepresentations made by those who surrounded him, respecting
its necessity and the ease of its prosecution. He had now the strongest
reasons for desiring the immediate return of peace. His marriage with the
daughter of the emperor had for some months been arranged, but Maximilian
refused to permit Elizabeth to become the queen of a country rent with
civil commotion. Catharine de' Medici, also, from the advocate of war,
had become anxious for peace&mdash;tardily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> returning to the conviction which
she had often expressed in former years, that the attempt to exterminate
the Huguenots by force of arms was hopeless. After two years she was no
nearer her object than when the Cardinal of Lorraine persuaded her to
endeavor to seize Condé at Noyers. Jarnac had accomplished nothing;
Moncontour was nearly as barren a victory. A great part of what had been
so laboriously effected by Anjou's army in the last months of 1569, La
Noue had been undoing in the first half of 1570.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> The Protestants,
who were, a few months since, shut up in La Rochelle, had defeated their
enemies at Sainte Gemme, near Luçon, and had retaken Fontenay, Niort, the
Isle d'Oléron, Brouage, and other places. The Baron de la Garde, who had
lately, in the capacity of "general of the galleys," been infesting the
seas in the neighborhood of La Rochelle, was compelled to retire to
Bordeaux.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Saintes had been besieged and captured, and the Huguenots
were advancing to the reduction of St. Jean d'Angely, not long since so

Pyrenees, when an army under Gaspard de Coligny, after sweeping four
hundred leagues through the southern and western provinces, was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> in
the immediate vicinity of Paris? His forces, indeed, were small in
numbers, but would speedily grow formidable. The French ambassador sent
from London the intelligence that letters of credit had been sent from
England to Hamburg in order to hasten the entrance into France of some
twelve or fifteen thousand Germans under Duke Casimir; that twenty-five
hundred men were to be despatched from La Rochelle to make a descent on
some point in Normandy or Brittany, in conjunction with the ships of the
Prince of Orange; and that the English were to be invited to
co-operate.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> If it had proved impracticable to prevent the Duc de
Deux Ponts from marching across France to join the confederates near the
ocean, what hope was there that the king would be able to hinder the
union of Coligny and Casimir? Or, why might not both be reinforced by the
troops of La Noue, who had been accomplishing such exploits in Aunis and
Saintonge?</p>

<p>The princes of Germany added their intercessions to the stern logic of
the conflict. During the festivities in Heidelberg, attending the
marriage of John Casimir, Duke of Bavaria, and Elizabeth, daughter of the
Elector of Saxony, in June, 1570, the Elector Palatine, the Elector of
Saxony, the Margraves George Frederick of Brandenburg and Charles of
Baden, Louis, Duke of Würtemberg, the Landgraves William, Philip and
George of Hesse, and Adolphus, Duke of Holstein, wrote a joint letter to
Charles the Ninth of France, in which they drew his attention to the
injury which the long war he was carrying on with his subjects was
inflicting upon the states of the empire, and to the necessity of
speedily terminating it if he would retain their good-will and
friendship. And they assured him that there was no way of accomplishing
this result except by permitting the exercise of the reformed religion
throughout the kingdom, and abolishing all distinctions between his
Majesty's subjects of different faiths.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anxiety of Cardinal Châtillon.</div>

<p>When the war had so signally failed, it is not strange that the king and
his mother should have turned once more to the advocates of peace, with
whose return to favor the retirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> of the Guises from court was
contemporaneous. Yet the Protestants, who knew too well from experience
the malignity of that hated family, could not but shudder lest they might
be putting themselves in the power of their most determined enemies. The
Queen of Navarre wrote to Charles urging him to use his own native good
sense, and assuring him that she feared "marvellously" that these
well-known mischief-makers would lure him into "a patched-up-peace"&mdash;<i>une
paix fourrée</i>&mdash;like the preceding pacifications. The object they had in
view was, indeed, the ruin of the Huguenots; but the first disaster, she
warned him, would fall on the monarch and his royal estate.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> Cardinal
Châtillon, when sounded by the French ambassador in England, expressed
his eagerness for peace. On selfish grounds alone he would be glad to
exchange poverty in England for his revenues of one hundred and twenty
thousand a year in France. But he had his fears. "Remembering that the
king, the queen, and monsieur (the Duke of Anjou), to confirm the last
peace, did him the honor to give him their word, placing their own hands
in his, and that those who induced them to break it were those very
persons with whom he and his associates now had to conclude the proposed
peace," he said, "his hair stood upon end with fear." All that the
Protestants wanted was security. They would be glad to transfer the war
elsewhere&mdash;a thing his brother the admiral had always desired; and, if
admitted to the king's favor, they would render his Majesty the most
notable service that had been done to the crown for two hundred
years.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Royal Edict of pacification, St. Germain, August 8, 1570.</div>

<p>The terms of the long-desired peace were at last decided upon by the
commissioners, among whom Téligny and Beauvoir la Nocle were most
prominent on the Protestant side, while Biron and De Mesmes represented
the court. On the eighth of August, 1570, they were officially
promulgated in a royal edict signed at St. Germain-en-Laye.</p>

<p>There were in this document the usual stipulations respecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> amnesty,
the prohibition of insults and recriminations, and kindred topics. The
liberty of religious profession was guaranteed. Respecting worship
according to the Protestant rites, the provision was of the following
character. All nobles entitled to "high jurisdiction"<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> were permitted
to designate one place belonging to them, where they could have religious
services for themselves, their families, their subjects, and all who
might choose to attend, so long as either they or their families were
present. This privilege, in the case of other nobles, was restricted to
their families and their friends, not exceeding ten in number. To the
Queen of Navarre a few places were granted in the fiefs which she held of
the French crown, where service could be celebrated even in her absence.
In addition to these, there was a list of cities, designated by name&mdash;two
in each of the twelve principal governments or provinces&mdash;in which, or in
the suburbs of which, the reformed services were allowed; and this
privilege was extended to all those places of which the Protestants had
possession on the first of the present month of August. From all other
places&mdash;from the royal court and its vicinity to a distance of two
leagues, and especially from Paris and its vicinity to the distance of
ten leagues&mdash;Protestant worship was strictly excluded. Provision was made
for Protestant burials, to take place in the presence of not more than
ten persons. The king recognized the Queen of Navarre, the prince her
son, and the late Prince of Condé and his son, as faithful relations and
servants; their followers as loyal subjects; Deux Ponts, Orange, and his
brothers, and Wolrad Mansfeld, as good neighbors and friends. There was
to be a restitution of property, honors, and offices, and a rescission of
judicial sentences. To protect the members of the reformed faith in the
courts of justice, they were to be permitted to challenge four of the
judges in the Parliament of Paris; six&mdash;three in each chamber&mdash;in those
of Rouen, Dijon, Aix, Rennes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> Grenoble; and four in each chamber of
the Parliament of Bordeaux. They were to be allowed a peremptory appeal
from the Parliament of Toulouse. To defend the Huguenots from popular
violence, four cities were to be intrusted to them for a period of two
years&mdash;La Rochelle, Montauban, Cognac, and La Charité&mdash;to serve as places
of refuge; and the Princes of Navarre and Condé, with twenty of their
followers, were to pledge their word for the safe restoration of these
cities to the king at the expiration of the designated term.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissatisfaction of the clergy.</div>

<p>Such were the leading features of the edict of pacification that closed
the third religious war, by far the longest and most sanguinary conflict
that had as yet desolated France. That the terms would be regarded as in
the highest degree offensive by the intolerant party at home and abroad
was to be expected. The Parisian curate, Jehan de la Fosse, only spoke
the common sentiment of the clergy and of the bigoted Roman Catholics
when he said that "it contained articles sufficiently terrible to make
France and the king's faithful servants tremble, seeing that the
Huguenots were reputed as faithful servants, and what they had done held
by the king to be agreeable."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> It was not astonishing, therefore,
that, although the publication of the edict was effected without delay
under the eyes of the court at Paris, it gave rise in Rouen to a serious
riot.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> The Papal Nuncio and the Spanish ambassador were indignant.
Both Pius and Philip had bitterly opposed the negotiations of the early
part of the year. Now their ambassadors made a fruitless attempt to put
off the evil day of peace; the Spanish ambassador not only offering three
thousand horse and six thousand foot to extirpate the Huguenots, but
affirming that "there were no conditions to which he was not ready to
bind himself, provided that the king would not make peace with the
heretics and rebels."<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">"The limping and unsettled peace."</div>

<p>For the first time in their history, the relations of the Huguenots of
France to the state were settled, not by a royal declaration which was to
be of force until the king should attain his majority, or until the
convocation of a general council of the Church, but by an edict which was
expressly stated to be "<i>perpetual and irrevocable</i>." Such the
Protestants, although with many misgivings, hoped that it might prove. It
was not, however, an auspicious circumstance that the popular wit, laying
hold of the fact that one of the Roman Catholic commissioners that drew
up its stipulations&mdash;Biron&mdash;was lame, while the other&mdash;Henri de
Mesmes&mdash;was best known as Lord of Malassise, conferred upon the new
compact the ungracious appellation of "<i>the limping and unsettled
peace</i>"&mdash;"la paix boiteuse et mal-assise."<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>

the exception of a brother who died in early youth, he was the oldest of
the family; but his quiet and more sluggish character inclined him to
accept the cardinal's hat, when offered to him by his uncle, the
constable; and, rich with the revenues of bishoprics and abbeys, he
subsequently renounced all his rights as eldest son to his brother
Gaspard. Froude is, however, in good company. Even the usually accurate

of order in public worship created no prejudice against the reformed
churches of France. Of this number was William Whittingham, Dean of
Durham, who, when he accompanied the Earl of Warwick, upon the occupation
of Havre in 1562, conformed the service of the English garrison to that
of the resident Protestants. Understanding that some of his countrymen
had made "frivolous" complaints of his action, the Dean justified himself
by Saint Augustine's counsel in such matters, and by alleging the
disastrous consequences a different course would have produced on the
minds of the French Protestants, who, he said, "as they had conceived
evil of the infinity of our rites and cold proceedings in religion, so if
they should have seen us (but in form only, though not in substance), to
use the same or like order in ceremonies which the papists had a little
afore observed (against whom they now venture goods and body), they would
to their great grief have suspected our doings as not sincere, and have
feared in time the loss of that liberty which after a sort they had
purchased with the bloodshedding of many thousands." And the dean
maintains the wisdom of the course pursued, having "perceived that it
wrought here a marvellous conjunction of minds between the French and us,
and brought singular comfort to all our people." The Bishop of London
seems to have concurred in these views, as well as Cuthbert Vaughan, and
probably Warwick himself. Whittingham to Cecil, Newhaven (Havre), Dec.
20, 1562, State Paper Office. It ought to be added that Whittingham, in
this letter, expresses in fact a preference for the French forms to the
English, as "most agreeable with God's Word, most approaching to the form
the godly Fathers used, best allowed of the learned and godly in these
days, and according to the example of the best reformed churches." Dean
Whittingham, who had married the sister of John Calvin, was a leader of
the Puritan party in the Church of England, and the editor and principal
translator of the "Genevan" version of the English Bible. His opponents
maintained that he was "a man not in holy orders, either according to the
Anglican or the Presbyterian rite." (History of the Church of England, by
G. G. Perry, Canon of Lincoln, New York, 1879, p. 303.) But a commission
appointed by the queen to look into the matter, after the dean had been
excommunicated by the Archbishop of York, reported that "William
Whittingham was ordained in a better sort than even the archbishop
himself." (Historic Origin of the Bible, by Edwin Cone Bissell, New York,
1873, p. 57.)</p></div>

termination of Condé's dishonorable attachment to Isabeau de Limueil are
proved by contemporary documents to be erroneous. The tears and
remonstrances of his wife Éléonore de Roye (see <i>ante</i>, chapter xiv.) may
have had some temporary effect. But an anonymous letter among the
Simancas MSS., written March 15, 1565 (and consequently more than six
months after Éléonore's death, which occurred July 23, 1564), portrays
him as "hora più che mai passionato per la sua Limolia." Duc d'Aumale,

Bonnet, Lettres franç., ii. 539) had rebuked the prince with his
customary frankness, warning him respecting his conduct, and saying that
"les bonnes gens en seront offenséz, les malins en feront leur risée," so
now Coligny and the Huguenot gentlemen of his suite united with the
Protestant ministers in begging him to renounce his present course of
life, and contract a second honorable marriage. The latter held up to him
"il pericolo et infamia propria, et il scandalo commune a tutta la
relligione per esserne lui capo;" the former threatened to leave him. I

widow, Jaqueline d'Entremont, or Antremont, had placed all the documents
she possessed, entreating him to undertake the pious task of compiling a
life of her husband. In a remarkable letter which has but lately come to
light, dated January 15, 1572 (new style 1573), after an exordium full of
those classical allusions of which the age was so fond, she writes: "Ne

him that "they [the Huguenots] desired to bring all to the form of a
republic, like Geneva." Smith records the conversation at length in a
letter to Cecil, wishing his correspondent to perceive "how he had need
of a long spoon that should eat potage with the Devil." The discussion
must have been an earnest one. Sir Thomas was not disposed to boast of
being a finished courtier. In fact, he declares that, as to framing
compliments, he is "the verriest calf and beast in the world," and
threatens to get one Bizzarro to write him some, which he will get
translated (for all sorts of people), and learn them by heart. He managed
on this occasion to speak his mind to Lorraine pretty freely respecting
the real origin of the war (the conversation took place in 1562), and
told the churchman the uncomplimentary truth, that his brother's deed at
Vassy was the cause of all the troubles. Smith to Cecil, Rouen, Nov. 7,

from the very first opposed to a resort to the horrors of war, is
certain. Agrippa d'Aubigné goes farther than this, and asserts (i. 293)
that she had become estranged from Condé in consequence of her blaming
the Huguenots for their assumption of arms: "blasmant ceux qui portoient
les armes, jusques à estre devenus ennemis, le Prince de Condé et elle,
sur cette querelle." I can scarcely credit this account, of which I see
no confirmation, unless it be in a letter to an unknown correspondent, in
the National Library (MSS. Coll. Béthune, 8703, fol. 68), of which a
translation is given in Memorials of Renée of France (London, 1859), 263,
264. It is dated Montargis, Aug. 20, 1569: "Praying you ... to employ
yourself, as I know you are accustomed to do, in whatsoever way shall be
possible to you, in striving to arrive at a good peace, in which endeavor
I, on my part, shall put forth all my power, if it shall please God. And
if it cannot be a general one, <i>at least it shall be to those who desire
it, and who belong to us</i>." Who, however, was the correspondent? The
subscription, "Your good cousin, Renée of France," would appear to point
to Admiral Coligny or some one of equal rank. Louis de Condé was no
longer living.</p></div>

Gastines, l'an 1571, vers Noel" (Mémoires de l'état de France sous
Charles IX., and Archives curieuses, vi. 475, etc.), contains the quaint
decree of the parliament. See Journal d'un curé ligueur (Jehan de la
Fosse), 107. As actually erected, the monument consisted of a high stone
pyramid, surmounted by a gilt crucifix. Besides the decree in question,
there were engraved some Latin verses of so confused a construction that
it was suggested that the composer intended to cast ridicule both on the
Roman Catholics and on the Huguenots. M. de Thou, who was a boy of
sixteen at the time&mdash;and who, as son of the first President of
Parliament, and himself, at a later time, a leading member and president
<i>à mortier</i> of that body, enjoyed rare advantages for arriving at the
truth&mdash;declares (iv. 488) that the elder Gastines was a venerable man,
beloved by his neighbors, and, indeed, by the entire city; and that the
execution was compassed by a cabal of seditious persons, who, by dint of
soliciting the judges, of exciting the people, of inducing them to
congregate and follow the judges with threats as they left parliament,
succeeded in causing to be punished with death, in the persons of the
Gastines, an offence which, until then, had been punished only with exile
or a pecuniary fine.</p></div>

after receiving intelligence of this judicial sentence and of the wanton
injury done to his palace at Châtillon-sur-Loing. "We must follow our
Head, Jesus Christ, who himself leads the way," he writes. "Men have
deprived us of all that it was in their power to take from us, and if it
be God's will that we never recover what we have lost, still we shall be
happy, and our condition will be a good one, inasmuch as these losses
have not arisen from any harm done by us to those who have brought them
upon us, but solely from the hatred they bear toward me for the reason
that it has pleased God to make use of me in assisting His Church."</p></div>

the combatants even saw visions of celestial champions, as Theseus was
fabled to have appeared at Marathon. A renegade Protestant captain
afterward assured the Cardinal of Alessandria that on that eventful day
he had seen in mid-air an array of warriors with refulgent armor and
blood-red swords, threatening the Huguenot lines in which he fought; and
he had instantly embraced the Roman Catholic faith, and vowed perpetual

reduces it to "over 8,000." Strange to say, Jean de Serres, who, writing
and publishing this portion of his history within a year after the
conclusion of the third civil war, almost uniformly gives the highest
estimates of the Roman Catholic losses, here makes them about 2,000, or
lower than any one else.</p></div>

in his journal (p. 22, Ed. Mich.) affirms that he was killed just as he
had uttered a blasphemous inquiry of the Huguenots, where was now their
"Dieu le Fort," and taunted them with his having become "à ceste heure
leur Dieu le Faible." "Le Dieu, le Fort, l'Éternel parlera," was the

were taken, to whom their captors promised their lives. Afterward there
were strenuous efforts made, especially by the priests, to have them put
to death as rebels and traitors. M. de la Chastre resisted the pressure,
disregarding even a severe order of the Parliament of Paris, accompanied
by the threat of the enormous fine of 2,000 marks of gold, which bade him
send them to the capital. (Hist. du Berry, etc., par M. Louis Raynal,
1846, iv, 104, <i>apud</i> Bulletin de la Soc. de l'hist. du prot. fr., iv.
(1856) 27.) Even Charles IX. wrote to him, but the governor was
inflexible. His noble reply has come to light, dated Jan. 21, 1570, just
one month after the failure of the Protestant scheme. After urging the
danger of retaliation by the Huguenots of La Charité and Sancerre upon
the prisoners they held, to the number of more than forty, and the
inexpediency of accustoming the people of Bourges to bloody executions
which they would not fail to repeat, he concludes his remonstrance in
these striking words: "Nevertheless, Sire, if you should find it
expedient, for the good of your service, to put them to death, the
channel of the courts of justice is the most proper, without recompensing
my services, or sullying my reputation with a stain that will ever be a
ground of reproach against me. And I beg you, Sire, to make use of me in
other matters more worthy of a gentleman having the heart of his
ancestors, who for five hundred years have served their king without
stain of treachery or act unworthy of a gentleman." Inedited letter,
<i>apud</i> Bulletin, <i>ubi supra</i>, 28, 29. M. de la Chastre became one of the
marshals of France. He conducted, three years later, the terrible siege
of Sancerre, famous in history. He had the reputation among the Huguenots
of being very severe, if not bloodthirsty&mdash;a reputation which he
deserved, if he was, as Henry of Navarre styles him, "un des principaux
exécuteurs de la Sainct Barthélemy." (Deposition in the trial of La Mole,
Coconnas, etc. Archives curieuses, viii. 150.) La Chastre tried to clear
himself of the imputation, by recalling the events of 1569. To Jean de
Léry he maintained "qu'il n'est point sanguinaire, ainsi qu'on a opinion,
comme aussi il l'avoit desjà bien monstré aux autres troubles, lorsqu'il
avoit en sa puissance les sieurs d'Espeau, baron de Renty, et le
capitaine Fontaine, qui est en son armée: car encores que la cour du
parlement de Paris luy fist commandement de les représenter, à peine de
2,000 marcs d'or, il ne le voulut faire." Jean de Léry, "Discours de

Admiral Coligny cross the Garonne and pass through Béarn, on his way from
Saintes to Montauban! A glance at the map of France will show that this
would have required a much greater bend to the right than he in reality
made to the left, since Béarn lay entirely south of the river Adour. To
reach Béarn by land <i>before</i> crossing the Garonne, as the "Vie" evidently
imagines he did, would almost have required Aladdin's lamp. In fact, the

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class='center'><a name="PEACE2" id="PEACE2"></a>THE PEACE OF SAINT GERMAIN.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sincerity of the peace.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
A problem of cardinal importance here confronts us, in the inquiry
whether the peace which had at length dawned upon France was or was not
concluded in good faith by the young king and his advisers. Was the
treaty a necessity forced upon the court by the losses of men and
treasure sustained during three years of almost continual civil conflict?
Were the queen mother and those in whose hands rested the chief control
of affairs, really tired of a war in which nothing was to be gained and
everything was in jeopardy, a war whose most brilliant successes had been
barren of substantial fruits, and had, in the sequel, been stripped of
the greater part of their glory by the masterly conduct of a defeated
opponent? Or, was the peace only a prelude to the massacre&mdash;a skilfully
devised snare to entrap incautious and credulous enemies?</p>

<p>The latter view is that which was entertained by the majority of the
contemporaries of the events, who, whether friends or foes of Charles and
Catharine, whether Papists or Protestants, could not avoid reading the
treaty of pacification in the light of the occurrences of the "bloody
nuptials." The Huguenot author of the "Tocsin against the murderers" and
Capilupi, author of the appreciative "Stratagem of Charles the
Ninth"&mdash;however much they may disagree upon other points&mdash;unite in
regarding the royal edict as a piece of treachery from beginning to end.
It was even believed by many of the most intelligent Protestants that the
massacre was already perfected in the minds of its authors so far back as
the conference of Bayonne, five years before the peace of St. Germain,
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> accordance with the suggestions of Philip the Second and of Alva.
This last supposition, however, has been overthrown by the discovery of
the correspondence of Alva himself, in which he gives an account of the
discussions which he held with Catharine de' Medici on that memorable
occasion. For we have seen that, far from convincing the queen mother of
the necessity for adopting sanguinary measures to crush the Huguenots,
the duke constantly deplores to his master the obstinacy of Catharine in
still clinging to her own views of toleration. It seems equally clear
that the peace of St. Germain was no part of the project of a
contemplated massacre of the Protestants. The Montmorencies, not the
Guises, were in power, and were responsible for it. The influence of the
former had become paramount, and that of the latter had waned. The
Cardinal of Lorraine had left the court in disgust and retired to his
archbishopric of Rheims, when he found that the policy of war, to which
he and his family were committed, was about to be abandoned. Even in the
earlier negotiations he had no part, while the queen mother and the
moderate Morvilliers were omnipotent.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> And when Francis Walsingham
made his appearance at the French court, to congratulate Charles the
Ninth upon the restoration of peace, he found his strongest reasons of
hope for its permanence, next to the disposition and the necessities of
the king, in the royal "misliking toward the house of Guise, who have
been the nourishers of these wars,"<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> and in the increase of the royal
"favor to Montmorency, a chief worker of this peace, who now carrieth the
whole sway of the court, and is restored to the government of
Paris."<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p><p>At home and abroad, the peace was equally opposed by those who could not
have failed to be its warmest advocates had it been treacherously
designed. We have already seen that both Pope Pius the Fifth, and the
King of Spain insisted upon a continuance of the war, and offered
augmented assistance, in case the government would pledge itself to make
no compact with the heretical rebels. The pontiff especially was
unremitting in his persuasions and threats; denouncing the righteous
judgment of God upon the king who preferred personal advantage to the
claims of religion, and reminding him that the divine anger was wont to
punish the sins of rulers by taking away their kingdoms and giving them
to others.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The project of a massacre of Protestants, had it in
reality been entertained by the French court while adopting the peace,
could scarcely have been kept so profound a secret from the king and the
pontiff who had long been urging a resort to such measures, nor would
Pius and Philip have been suffered through ignorance to persist in so
open a hostility to the compact which was intended to render its
execution feasible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The designs of Catharine de' Medici.</div>

<p>If the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, as enacted on the fatal Sunday
of August, was not premeditated in the form it then assumed&mdash;if the peace
of St. Germain was not, as so many have imagined, a trick to overwhelm
the Huguenots taken unawares&mdash;are we, therefore, to believe that the idea
of such a deed of blood was as yet altogether foreign to the mind of
Catharine de' Medici? I dare not affirm that it was. On the contrary,
there is reason to believe that the conviction that she might some day
find herself in a position in which she could best free herself from
entanglement by some such means had long since lodged in her mind. It was
not a strange or repulsive notion to the careful student of the code of
morality laid down in "Il Principe." Alva had familiarized her with it,
and the civil wars had almost invested it in her eyes with the appearance
of justifiable retaliation. She had gloated in secret over the story of
the Queen Blanche, mother of Louis the Ninth, and her successful struggle
with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> son's insubordinate nobles, telling her countryman, the
Venetian ambassador Correro, with a significant laugh such as she was
wont occasionally to indulge in, that she would be very sorry to have it
known that she had been reading the old manuscript chronicle, for they
would at once infer that she had taken the Castilian princess as her
pattern.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> More unscrupulous than the mother of St. Louis, she had
revolved in her mind various schemes for strengthening her authority at
the expense of the lives of a few of the more prominent Huguenot chiefs,
convinced, as she was, that Protestantism would cease to exist in France
with the destruction of its leaders. But, despite pontifical injunctions
and Spanish exhortations, she formed no definite plans; or, if she did,
it was only to unravel on the morrow what she had woven the day before.
What Barbaro said of her at one critical juncture was true of her
generally in all such deliberations: "Her irresolution is extreme; she
conceives new plans from hour to hour; within the compass of a single
day, between morning and evening, she will change her mind three
times.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles the Ninth in earnest.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He tears out the record against Cardinal Châtillon.</div>

<p>While it is scarcely possible to believe Catharine to have been more
sincere in the adoption of this peace than in any other event of her
life, we may feel some confidence that her son was really in favor of
peace for its own sake. He was weary of the war, jealous of his brother
Anjou, disgusted with the Guises, and determined to attempt to conciliate
his Huguenot subjects, whom he had in vain been trying to crush.
Apparently he wished to make of the amnesty, which the edict formally
proclaimed, a veritable act of oblivion of all past offences, and
intended to regard the Huguenots, in point of fact as well as in law, as
his faithful subjects. An incident which occurred about two months after
the conclusion of peace, throws light upon the king's new disposition.
Cardinal Odet de Châtillon, deprived by the Pope of his seat in the Roman
consistory, had, on motion of Cardinal Bourbon, been declared by the
Parisian parliament to have lost his bishopric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> of Beauvais, on account
of his rebellion and his adoption of Protestant sentiments. All such
judicial proceedings had indeed been declared null and void by the terms
of the pacification, but the parliaments showed themselves very reluctant
to regard the royal edict. In October, 1570, Charles the Ninth happening
to be a guest of Marshal Montmorency at his palace of Écouen, a few
leagues north of Paris, sent orders to Christopher de Thou, the first
president, to wait upon him with the parliamentary records. Aware of the
king's object, De Thou, pleading illness, sent four of his counsellors
instead; but these were ignominiously dismissed, and the presence of the
chief judge was again demanded. When De Thou at last appeared, Charles
greeted him roughly. "Here you are," he said, "and not very ill, thank
God! Why do you go counter to my edicts? I owe our cousin, Cardinal
Bourbon, no thanks for having applied for and obtained sentence against
the house of Châtillon, <i>which has done me so much service, and took up
arms for me</i>." Then calling for the records, he ordered the president to
point out the proceedings against the admiral's brother, and, on finding
them, tore out with his own hand three leaves on which they were
inscribed; and on having his attention directed by the marshal, who stood
by, to other places bearing upon the same case, he did not hesitate to
tear these out also.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His assurances to Walsingham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gracious answer to the German electors.</div>

<p>To all with whom he conversed Charles avowed his steadfast purpose to
maintain the peace inviolate. He called it his own peace. He told
Walsingham, "he willed him to assure her Majesty, that the only care he
presently had was to entertain the peace, whereof the Queen of Navarre
and the princes of the religion could well be witnesses, as also
generally the whole realm."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> And the shrewd diplomatist believed that

circumstances with which Charles was surrounded, and the vicious and
irreligious education he had received, there was room for solicitude
respecting his stability.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> There was, indeed, much to strengthen the
hands of Charles in his new policy of toleration. On the twenty-sixth of
November he married, with great pomp and amid the display of the popular
delight, Elizabeth, daughter of the Emperor Maximilian the Second. This
union, far from imperilling the permanence of the peace in France,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>
was likely to render it more lasting, if the bridegroom could be induced
to copy the conciliatory and politic example of his father-in-law. Not
long after Charles received at Villers-Cotterets an embassy sent by the
three Protestant electors of Germany and the other powerful princes of
the same faith. They congratulated him upon the suppression of civil
disorder in France, and entreated him to maintain freedom of worship in
his dominions such as existed in Germany and even in the dominions of the
Grand Turk; lending an ear to none who might attempt to persuade him that
tranquillity could not subsist in a kingdom where there was more than one
religion. Charles made a gracious answer, and the German ambassadors
retired, leaving the friends of the Huguenots to entertain still better
hopes for the recent treaty.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine warned by the Huguenots.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Infringement on the edict at Orange.</div>

<p>It cannot be denied, however, that the Huguenots could see much that was
disquieting and calculated to prevent them from laying aside their
suspicions. There were symptoms of the old constitutional timidity on the
part of Catharine de' Medici. She showed signs of so far yielding to the
inveterate enemies of the Huguenots as to abstain from insisting upon the
concession of public religious worship where it had been accorded by the
Edict of St. Germain. No wonder that the Huguenots, on their side, warned
her, with friendly sincerity and frankness, that, should she refuse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
entertain their just demands, <i>the present peace would be only a brief
truce, the prelude to a relentless civil war</i>. "We will all die," was
their language, "rather than forsake our God and our religion, which we
can no more sustain without public exercise than could a body live
without food and drink."<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> Not only did the courts throw every
obstacle in the way of the formal recognition of the law establishing the
rights of the Huguenots, but the outbreaks of popular hatred against the
adherents of the purer faith were alarming evidence that the chronic sore
had only been healed over the surface, and that none of the elements of
future disorder and bloodshed were wanting. Thus, in the little city and
principality of Orange, the Roman Catholic populace, taking advantage of
the supineness of the governor and of the consuls, introduced within the
walls, under cover of a three days' religious festival, a large number of
ruffians from the adjoining Comtât Venaissin. This was early in February,
1571. Now began a scene of rapine and bloodshed that might demand
detailed mention, were it not that at the frequent repetition of such
ghastly recitals the stoutest heart sickens. Men, and even mere boys, of
the reformed faith were butchered in their homes, in the arms of their
wives or their mothers. The goods of Protestants were plundered and
openly sold to the highest bidder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> Of many, a ransom was exacted for
their safety. The work went on for two weeks. At last a deputy from
Orange reached the Huguenot princes and the admiral at La Rochelle, and
Count Louis of Nassau, who was still there, wrote to Charles with such
urgency, in the name of his brother, the Prince of Orange, that measures
were taken to repress and punish the disorder.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Protestants at Rouen attacked, March 4, 1571.</div>

<p>A much more serious infringement upon the protection granted to the
Protestants by the edict, took place at Rouen about a month later. Unable
to celebrate their worship within the city walls, the Protestants had
gone out one Sunday morning to the place assigned them for this purpose
in the suburbs. Meantime a body of four hundred Roman Catholics posted
themselves in ambush near the gates to await their return. When the
unsuspecting Huguenots, devoutly meditating upon the solemnities in which
they had been engaged, made their appearance, they were greeted first
with imprecations and blasphemies, then with a murderous attack. Between
one hundred and one hundred and twenty are said to have been killed or
wounded. The punishment of this audacious violation of the rights of the
Protestants was at first left by parliament to the inferior or presidial
judges, and the investigation dragged. The judges were threatened as they
went to court: "Si l'on sçavoit que vous eussiez informé, on vous
creveroit les yeux; si vous y mectez la main, on vous coupera la gorge!"
The people broke into the prisons and liberated the accused. The civic
militia refused to interfere. It was evident that no justice could be
obtained from the local magistrates. The king, however, on receiving the
complaints of the Huguenots, displayed great indignation, and despatched
Montmorency to Rouen with twenty-seven companies of soldiers, and a
commission authorized to try the culprits. The greater part of these,
however, had fled. Only five persons received the punishment of death;
several hundred fugitives were hung in effigy. Montmorency attempted to
secure the Protestants against fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>ther aggression by disarming the
entire population, with the exception of four hundred chosen men, and by
compelling the parliament, on the fifteenth of May, to swear to observe
the Edict of Pacification&mdash;precautions whose efficacy we shall be able to
estimate more accurately by the events of the following year.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Croix de Gastines" again.</div>

<p>The strength of the popular hatred of the Huguenots was often too great
for even the government to cope with. The rabble of the cities would hear
of no upright execution of the provisions respecting the oblivion of past
injuries, and resisted with pertinacity the attempt to remove the traces
of the old conflict. The Parisians gave the most striking evidence of
their unextinguished rancor in the matter of the "Croix de Gastines," a
monument of religious bigotry, the reasons for whose erection in 1569
have been sufficiently explained in a previous chapter.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>More than a year had passed since the promulgation of the royal edict of
pacification annulling all judgments rendered against Protestants since
the death of Henry the Second; and yet the Croix de Gastines still stood
aloft on its pyramidal base, upon the site of the Huguenot place of
meeting. Several times, at the solicitation of the Protestants, the
government ordered its demolition. The municipal officers of Paris
declined to obey, because it had not been erected by them; the
parliament, because, as they alleged, the sentence was just and they
could not retract; the Provost of Paris, because he was not above
parliament, which had placed it there.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Charles himself wrote with
his own hand to the provost: "You deliberate whether to obey me, and
whether you will have that fine pyramid overturned. I forbid you to
appear in my presence until it be cast down."<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> The end was not yet.
The monks preached against the sacrilege of lowering the cross. Maître
Vigor, on the first Sunday of Advent, praised the people of Paris for
having opposed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> demolition, maintaining that they had acted "only
from zeal for God, who upon the cross suffered for us." "The people," he
declared, "had never murmured when they had taken down Gaspard de
Coligny, who had been hung in effigy, and <i>would soon, God willing, be
hung in very deed!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Meantime, the mob of Paris exhibited its zeal
for the honor of the cross by assailing the soldiers sent to tear down
the "Croix de Gastines," and by breaking open and plundering the contents
of several Huguenot houses. It was not until the provost had called in
the assistance of Marshal Montmorency, and the latter had killed a few of
the seditious Parisians who opposed his progress, and hung one man to the
windows of a neighboring house, that the disturbance ceased. The pyramid
was then destroyed, and the cross transferred to the Cimetière des
Innocents, where it is said to have remained until the outbreak of the
French Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> The "plucking down of the cross" was a
distasteful draught to the fanatics. "The common people," wrote an
eye-witness, "ease their stomacks onely by uttering seditious words,
which is borne withal, for that was doubted. The Protestants by the
overthrow of this cross receive greater comfort, and the papists the
contrary."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Projected marriage of Anjou to Queen Elizabeth.</div>

<p>The Huguenot leaders, rejoicing at any evidence of the royal favor,
desired to strengthen it and render it more stable. For this purpose they
found a rare opportunity in projecting matrimonial alliances. Queen
Elizabeth, of England, was yet unmarried, a princess of acknowledged
ability, and reigning over a kingdom, which, if it had not at that time
attained the wealth of industry and commerce which it now possesses, was,
at least, one of the most illustrious in Christendom. Where could a more
advantageous match be sought for Henry of Anjou, the French monarch's
brother? True, the Tudor princess was no longer young, and her personal
appearance was scarcely praised, except by her courtiers. She had been a
candidate for many projected nuptials, but in none had the disparity of
age been so great as in the present case, for, being a maiden of
thirty-seven, she lacked but a single year of being twice as old as
Anjou.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Besides these objections, and independently of the difference
of creed between the queen and Anjou, she had the unenviable reputation
of being irresolute, fickle, and capricious. And yet, in spite of all
these difficulties, the match was seriously proposed and entertained in
the autumn and winter succeeding the ratification of peace.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that the scheme originated with the French
Protestants. Cardinal Châtillon, the admiral's brother, and the Vidame of
Chartres, both of them zealous partisans of the Reformation, and at this
time engaged in negotiations in England, were the first to make mention
of the plan, and probably it took its rise in their minds. Their object
was manifest: if France could be united to Protestant England by so
distinguished a marriage, the permanence of the peace of St. Germain
might be regarded as secure. Under such auspices, the Huguenots, long
proscribed and persecuted, might hope for such favor and toleration as
they had never yet enjoyed.</p>

<p>Catharine de' Medici, when approached on the subject, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span> indications
of hearty acquiescence. Of late there had been a growing estrangement
between the French and Spanish courts. The selfishness and arrogance of
Philip and his ministers had been particularly evident and offensive
during the late war. It was sufficiently clear that the Catholic king
opposed the peace less from hatred of heresy or of rebellion, than
because of his scarcely disguised hope of profiting by the misfortunes of
France. The queen mother was consequently quite inclined to tighten the
bonds of amity and friendship with England, when those that had
previously existed with Spain were loosened. The prospect of a crown for
her favorite son was an alluring one&mdash;doubly so, because of Nostradamus's
prophecy that she would see all her sons upon the throne, to which she
gave a superstitious credence, trembling lest it should involve in its
fulfilment their untimely death. It is true that, in view of Elizabeth's
age, she would have preferred to marry the Duke of Anjou to some princess
of the royal house of England, whom Elizabeth might first have proclaimed
her heir and successor.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> However, as the English queen was, perhaps,
even more reluctant than the majority of mankind to be reminded of her
advancing years and of her mortality, Catharine's ambassador may have
deemed it advisable to be silent regarding the suggestion of so palpable
a "memento mori," and contented himself with offering for her own
acceptance the hand of one whom he recommended as "the most accomplished
prince living, and the most deserving her good graces."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Elizabeth
received the proposal with courtesy, merely alluding to the great
difference between her age and Anjou's, but admitted her apprehension
lest, since "she was already one whose kingdom rather than herself was to
be wedded," she might marry one who would honor her as a queen rather
than love her as a woman. In fact, the remembrance of the amours of the
father and grandfather made her suspicious of the son, and the names of
Madame d'Estampes and of Madame de Valentinois (Diana of Poitiers)
inspired her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> no little fear. All which coy suggestions La Mothe
Fénélon, astute courtier that he was, knew well how to answer.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Machinations to dissuade Anjou.</div>

<p>Soon, however, the difficulty threatened to be the unwillingness of the
suitor, rather than the reluctance of the lady. Henry of Anjou was the
head of the Roman Catholic party in France. Charles's orthodoxy might be
suspected; there was no doubt of his brother's. His intimacy with the
Guises, his successes as general of the royal forces in what was styled a
war in defence of religion, were guarantees of his devotion to the papal
cause. All his prestige would be lost if he married the heretical
daughter of Henry the Eighth and Anne Boleyn. Hence desperate efforts
were made to deter him&mdash;efforts which did not escape the Argus-eyed
Walsingham. "The Pope, the King of Spain, and the rest of the
confederates, upon the doubt of a match between the queen, my mistress,
and monsieur, do seek, by what means they can, to dissuade and draw him
from the same. They offer him to be the head and chief executioner of the
league against the Turk, a thing now newly renewed, though long ago
meant; which league is thought to stretch to as many as they repute to be
Turks, although better Christians than themselves. The cause of the
Cardinal of Lorraine's repair hither from Rheims, as it is thought, was
to this purpose."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles indignant at the interference.</div>

<p>Charles the Ninth was indignant at this interference, and said: "If this
matter go forward, it behooveth me to make some counter-league," having
his eye upon the German Protestant princes and Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Besides,
there were at this juncture other reasons for displeasure, especially
with Spain. Charles and his mother had received a rebuff from Sebastian
of Portugal, to whom they had offered Margaret of Valois in marriage. The
young king had replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> through Malicorne, "that they were both young,
and that therefore about eight years hence that matter might be better
talked of," "which disdainful answer," the English ambassador wrote from
the French court, "is accepted here in very ill part, and is thought not
to be done without the counsel of Spain."<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alençon to be substituted as suitor.</div>

<p>With Henry of Anjou, however, much to the disgust and disappointment of
his mother, the "league" succeeded too well. Scarcely had a month passed,
before Catharine was compelled to write to the envoy in England, telling
him that Henry had heard reports unfavorable to Elizabeth's character,
and positively declined to marry her.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> In her extreme perplexity at
this unexpected turn of events, the queen mother suggested to La Mothe
Fénélon that perhaps the Duke of Alençon would do as well, and might step
into the place which his brother had so ungallantly abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Now,
as this Alençon was a beardless boy of sixteen, and, unlike Charles and
Henry, small for his age, it is not surprising that La Mothe declared
himself utterly averse to making any mention of him for the present, lest
the queen should come to the very sensible conclusion that the French
were "making sport of her."<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anjou's new ardor.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth interposes obstacles.</div>

<p>But there was at present no need of resorting to substitution. For a time
the ardor of Anjou was rekindled, and rapidly increased in intensity.
Catharine first wrote that Anjou "condescended" to marry Elizabeth;<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
presently, that "he desired infinitely to espouse her."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> A month or
two later he declared to Walsingham: "I must needs confess that, through
the great commendation that is made of the queen your mistress, for her
rare gifts as well of mind as of body, being (as even her very enemies
say) the rarest creature that was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span> Europe these five hundred years; my
affection, grounded upon so good respects, hath now made me yield to be
wholly hers."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> On the other hand, Elizabeth began to exhibit such
coldness that her most intimate servants doubted her sincerity in the
entire transaction. With more candor than courtiers usually exhibit in
urging a suit which they suspect to be distasteful to their sovereign,
Lord Burleigh, the Earl of Leicester, and Sir Francis Walsingham used
every means of persuading the queen to decisive action. "My very good
Lord," wrote Walsingham, on the fourteenth of May, 1571, "the Protestants
here do so earnestly desire this match; and on the other side, the
papists do so earnestly seek to impeach the same, as it maketh me the
more earnest in furthering of the same. Besides, when I particularly
consider her Majesty's state, both at home and abroad, so far forth as my
poor eyesight can discern; and how she is beset with foreign peril, the
execution whereof stayeth only upon the event of this match, I do not see
how she can stand if this matter break off."<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> Lord Burleigh, in
perplexity on account of Elizabeth's conduct, exclaimed that "he was not
able to discern what was best;" but added: "Surely I see no continuance
of her quietness without a marriage, and therefore I remit the success to
Almighty God."<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> The situation of Elizabeth's servants was, indeed,
extremely embarrassing. Their mistress had laid an insuperable obstacle
in the way. She did not, indeed, require Anjou to abjure his faith, but
her demands virtually involved this. Not only did she refuse to grant the
duke, by the articles of marriage, public or even private worship for
himself and his attendants, according to the rites of the Roman Catholic
Church, but she wished to bind him to make no request to that effect
after marriage.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> In vain did Catharine protest that this was to
require him to become an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> atheist, and her own advisers solemnly warn her
that this could but lead to an entire rupture of the negotiations. Under
the pretence of excluding all exercise of Popery from England, the queen
disappointed the ardent hopes of thousands of sincere and thorough
Protestants in France and of many more in England, who viewed the
marriage as by far the most advisable cure&mdash;far better than a simple
treaty of peace&mdash;for the ills of both kingdoms. "If you find not in her
Majesty," wrote Walsingham to Leicester, "a resolute determination to
marry&mdash;a thing most necessary for our staggering state&mdash;then were it
expedient to take hold of amity, which may serve to ease us for a time,
though our disease requireth another remedy;" and again, a few days later
(on the third of August, 1571): "My lord, if neither marriage nor amity
may take place, the poor Protestants here do think then their case
desperate. They tell me so with tears, and therefore I do believe them.
And surely, if they say nothing, beholding the present state here, I
could not but see it most apparent."<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Papal and Spanish efforts.</div>

<p>The fears of the Protestants were not baseless. As the marriage, and the
consequent close friendship with England, seemed to insure the growth and
spread of the reformed faith,<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> the failure of both was an almost
unmistakable portent of the triumph of the opposite party and of the
renewal of persecution and bloodshed. And so also the fanatical Roman
Catholics read the signs of the times, and again they plied Anjou with
their seductions. "Great practices are here for the impeachment of this
match," wrote the English ambassador, near the end of July, 1571. "The
Papal Nuncio, Spain, and Portugal, are daily courtiers to dissuade this
match. The clergy here have offered Monsieur a great pension, to stay him
from proceeding. In conclusion, there is nothing left undone, that may be
thought fit to hinder."<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Vexation of Catharine at Anjou's fresh scruples.</div>

<p>And these intrigues were not fruitless. Anjou now declared to his mother
that he would not go to England without public assurances that he should
enjoy the liberty to exercise his own religion. He was unwilling even to
trust the queen's word, as Catharine and Charles would have wished him to
do. Catharine meantime expressed her vexation in her despatches to La
Mothe Fénélon.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> "We strongly suspect," she said, "that Villequier,
Lignerolles, or Sarret, or possibly all three, may be the authors of
these fancies. If we succeed in obtaining some certainty respecting this
matter, I assure you that they will repent of it."<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> But she added
that, should the negotiation unfortunately fail, she was resolved to put

easily suited.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>In fact, while Anjou was indifferent, or perhaps disgusted at the
obstacles raised in the way of the marriage, and was unwilling to
sacrifice his attachment to the party in connection with which he had
obtained whatever distinction he possessed; and while Elizabeth, who was
by no means blind, saw clearly enough that she was likely to get a
husband who would regard his bride rather as an incumbrance than as an
acquisition,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> two persons who were as eager as
Elizabeth's advisers, or the Huguenots themselves, to see the match
effected. These were Charles the Ninth and Catharine de' Medici, both of
whom just now gave abundant evidence of their disposition to draw closer
to England and to the Huguenots of France and the Gueux of Holland, while
suffering the breach between France and Spain to become more marked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Louis of Nassau confers with the king.</div>

<p>Count Louis of Nassau, ever since the conclusion of peace, had remained
with the Huguenots within the walls of La Rochelle. At the repeated
solicitations of his brother, the Prince of Orange, he had entered into
correspondence with the king, and urged him to embrace an opportunity
such as might never return, to endear himself to the Netherlanders, and
add materially to the extent and power of France by espousing the cause
of constitutional rights. His advances were so favorably received that he
now came in disguise, accompanied by La Noue, Téligny, and Genlis, to
confer with Charles upon the subject. They met at Lumigny-en-Brie,
whither the king had gone to indulge in his favorite pastime of the
chase, and on several consecutive days held secret conferences.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
Louis was a nobleman whose history and connections entitled him to
respect; but his frank and sincere character was a still more powerful
advocate in his behalf.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> He proved to the king how justly he might
interfere in defence of the Low Countries, where Philip was seeking "to
plant, by inquisition, the foundation of a most horrible tyranny, the
overthrow of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> freedoms and liberties." He traced the course of events
since the humiliating treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, and added: "If you
think in conscience and honor you may not become the protector of this
people, you should do well to forbear, for otherwise the success cannot
be gained. If you think you may, then weigh in policy how beneficial it
will be for you, and how much your father would have given, to have had
the like opportunity offered unto him that is now presented unto you
gratis; which, if you refuse, the like you must never look for."</p>

<p>Both Charles and his mother appeared well pleased with the proposal, and
the king, who had listened attentively to the recital of the follies into
which Philip had fallen in consequence of listening to evil advice,
exclaimed: "Similar counsellors, by violating my edict, wellnigh brought
me into like terms with my subjects, wherefrom ensued the late troubles;
but now, thank God, He has opened my eyes to discern what their meaning
was." Next, Louis showed that success was not difficult. The Roman
Catholics and the Protestants in the Netherlands equally detested the
tyranny of the Spaniards. The towns were ready to receive garrisons.
Philip had not in the whole country over three thousand troops upon whose
fidelity he could rely. The addition of a dozen ships to those already
possessed by the patriots would enable them effectually to prevent the
landing of Spanish reinforcements. In short, the Netherlands were ripe
for a division which would amply recompense France and the German
princes, as well as Queen Elizabeth, should she, as was hoped, consent to
take part in the enterprise: for the provinces of Flanders and Artois,
which had once belonged to the French crown, would gladly give themselves
up to Charles; Brabant, Gelderland, and Luxemburg would be restored to
the empire; and Holland, Zealand, and the rest of the islands would fall
to the share of the queen.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Admiral Coligny consulted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He marries Jacqueline d'Entremont.</div>

<p>So favorably did Charles and his mother, with those counsellors to whom
the secret was intrusted, receive the count's advances, that it was
clearly advisable to bring them into com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>munication with Admiral Coligny,
to whose conduct the enterprise, if adopted, must be confided, and for
whom the young king expressed great esteem. Indeed, so urgently was the
admiral invited, and so intimately did the success or failure of the
attempt to enlist France in the Flemish war seem to be dependent upon his
personal influence, that Gaspard de Coligny, despite the ill-concealed
solicitude of many of his more suspicious friends, consented to trust
himself in the king's hands. As for himself, the admiral had little
desire to leave the secure retreat of La Rochelle. Here he was surrounded
by friends. Here his happiness had been enhanced by two marriages which
promised to add greatly to the wealth and influence he already possessed.
Jacqueline d'Entremont, the widow of a brave officer killed in the civil
wars, had long entertained an admiration, which she made no attempt to
disguise, for the bravery and piety of the stern leader of the Huguenots.
Possessed of very extensive estates in the dominions of the Duke of
Savoy, she had also the qualities of mind and disposition which fitted
her to become the wife of so upright and magnanimous a man. The proposals
of marriage are said to have come from her relatives, nor did the lady
herself hesitate to express the wish before her death to become the
Marcia of the new Cato.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> The nuptials were celebrated with great pomp
at La Rochelle, whither Jacqueline, after having been married by
proxy,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> was escorted by a goodly train of Huguenot nobles. Great were
the rejoicings of the people, but not less great the anger of the Duke of
Savoy, who, as Jacqueline's feudal lord, claimed the right to dispose of
her hand, and had peremptorily forbidden her to marry the admiral. The
barbarous revenge which Emmanuel Philibert too soon found it in his power
to inflict upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> the unfortunate widow of Coligny forms the subject for
one of the darkest pages of modern history.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Under no less auspicious
circumstances was consummated the union of Coligny's daughter, Louise de
Châtillon, to Téligny, a young noble whose skill as a diplomatist seemed
to have destined him to hold a foremost rank among statesmen. Scarcely
less unhappy, however, than her step-mother, Louise was to behold both
her father and her husband perish in a single hour by the same dreadful
catastrophe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accepts the invitation to court.</div>

<p>Was it foolish rashness or overweening presumption that led the admiral
to leave the new home he had made within the strong defences of La
Rochelle; or was he moved solely by a conscientious persuasion that he
had no right to consider personal danger when the great interests of his
country and his faith were at stake? The former view has not been without
its advocates, some of whom have gloried in finding the proofs of a
judicial blindness sent by Heaven to hasten the self-induced destruction
of the Huguenots. A more careful consideration of all the circumstances
of the case, illustrated by a better appreciation of Coligny's character,
rather induces me to adopt the opposite conclusion. Certainly the noble
language of Coligny in reply to the warnings of his friends, both now and
later, when he was about to venture within the walls of Paris, displayed
no unconsciousness of the perils by which he was environed. "Better,
however, were it," he said, "to die a thousand deaths, than by undue
solicitude for life to be the occasion of keeping up distrust throughout
an entire kingdom."</p>

<p>About the beginning of September, 1571, Charles and his court repaired to
Blois, on the banks of the Loire.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> The avowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> object of the movement
was to meet Coligny and the Protestant princes. "There are many practices
(intrigues) to overthrow this journey," wrote Walsingham, about the
middle of the preceding month, "but the king sheweth himself to be very
resolute. I am most constantly assured that the king conceiveth of no
subject that he hath, better than of the admiral, and great hope there is
that the king will use him in matters of greatest trust; for of himself
he beginneth to see the insufficiency of others&mdash;some, for that they are
more addicted to others than to himself; others, for that they are more
Spanish than French, or else given more to private pleasures than public.
There is none of any account within this realm, whose as well
imperfections as virtues, he knoweth not. Those that do love him, do
lament that he is so much given to pleasure: they hope the admiral's
access unto the court will yield some redress in that case. Queen mother,
seeing her son so well affected towards him, laboreth by all means to
cause him to think well of her. She seemeth much to further the
meeting."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">His honorable reception.</div>

<p>Nothing could surpass the honorable reception of the admiral, when, on
the twelfth of September, he arrived with a small retinue at court in the
city of Blois. On first coming into the royal presence, he humbly
kneeled, but Charles graciously lifted him up, and embraced him, calling
him his father, and protesting that he regarded this as one of the
happiest days of his life, since he saw the war ended and tranquillity
confirmed by Coligny's return. "You are as welcome," said he, "as any
gentleman that has visited my court in twenty years." And in the same
interview, he expressed his joy in words upon which subsequent events
placed a sinister construction, but which nevertheless appear to have
been uttered in good faith: "At last we have you with us, and you will
not leave us again whenever you wish."<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> Nor was Catharine behind her
son in affability. She surprised the courtiers by honoring the Huguenot
leader with a kiss. And even Anjou, who chanced to be indisposed,
received him in his bedchamber with a show of friendliness. More
substantial tokens of favor followed. The same person, who, as the
principal general of the rebels, had been attainted of treason, his
castle and possessions being confiscated or destroyed by decree of the
first parliament of France, and a reward of fifty thousand gold crowns
being set upon his head, now received from the king's private purse the
unsolicited gift of one hundred thousand livres, to make good his losses
during the war. Moreover, he was presented with the revenues of his
lately deceased brother, the Cardinal Odet de Châtillon, for the space of
one year, and was intrusted with the lucrative office of guardian of the
house of Laval during the minority of its heir. Indeed, throughout his
stay at Blois, which was protracted through several weeks, Coligny was
the favored confidant of Charles, who sometimes even made him preside in
the royal council.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p><p>Moreover, it was doubtless at Coligny's suggestion that the king at this
time wrote to the Duke of Savoy interceding for those Waldenses who in
the recent wars had aided the French Protestants in arms, and who since
their return to the ducal dominions had experienced severe persecution on
that account. "I desire," he says in this letter, "to make a request of
you, a request of no ordinary character, but as earnest as you could
possibly receive from me&mdash;that, just as for the love of me you have
treated your subjects in this matter with unusual rigor, so you would be
pleased, for my sake, and by reason of my prayer and special
recommendation, to receive them into your benign grace, and reinstate
them in the possessions which have for this cause been confiscated." He
added that he desired not only to exhibit to his Protestant subjects his
intention to execute his edict, but to extend to their allies from abroad
the same love and protection.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disgust of the Guises and of Alva.</div>

<p>These and other marks of honorable distinction shown to the acknowledged
head of the Huguenots, must have been excessively distasteful both to the
Guises and to the Spaniard. The former now retired from court, and left
Charles completely in the hands of the Montmorencies and the
admiral.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> Earlier in the year, the Duke of Alva had met with a signal
rebuff at the hands of the French, when, in return for the aid furnished
to Charles by his Catholic Majesty during the late wars, he requested him
to supply him with German reiters, to allow him to levy in France troops
to serve against the Prince of Orange, and to detain the fleet which was
said to be preparing for the prince at La Rochelle. The first two demands
were peremptorily refused, while the ships, it was re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>plied, were
intended merely to make reprisals upon the Spaniards, who had taken some
Protestant vessels, drowned a part of their crew in the ocean, and
delivered others into the power of the Inquisition, and could not be
interfered with.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> The Spanish ambassador had borne with the
offensiveness of this answer; but the favor with which the Huguenots were
now received, and the openness with which the Flemish war was discussed,
rendered his further stay impossible. It is true that the interviews of
Louis of Nassau with the king were held with great secrecy, and that
Charles even had the effrontery to deny that he had met the brother of
Orange at all.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> It was impossible to deny that Philip's subjects were
despoiled by vessels which issued with impunity from La Rochelle. But,
although the ambassador declared that these grievances must be redressed,
or war would ensue, he was bluntly informed by Charles that "Philip might
not look to give laws to France." Catharine partook of her son's
indignation, the more so as she seems at this time to have shared in the
current belief that her daughter Elizabeth had been poisoned by her royal
husband.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> At last, in November, the ambassador withdrew from court,
without taking leave of the king, after having, in scarcely disguised
contempt,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> given away to the monks the silver plate which Charles had
presented to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles gratified.</div>

<p>While the new policy of conciliation and toleration thus disgusted one,
at least, of those foreign powers which had spurred on the government to
engage in suicidal civil contests, it was at home producing the
beneficent results hoped for by its authors. Charles himself appeared to
be daily more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> convinced of its excellence. In a letter to President Du
Ferrier, the French envoy at Constantinople, written during the admiral's
stay at Blois, he exposed for the sultan's benefit the reasons for the
mutation in his treatment of the Huguenots, and for the cordial reception
he had given Coligny at his court. "You know," he said, "that this
kingdom fell into discord and division, in which it still is involved. I
forgot no prescription which I thought might cure it of this ulcerous
wound; at one time trying mild remedies, at others applying the most
caustic, without sparing my own person, or those whom nature made most
dear to me.... But, having at length discovered that only time could
alleviate the ill, and <i>that those who were at the windows were very glad
to see the game played at my expense</i>,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> I had recourse to my original
plan, which was that of mildness; and by good advice I made my Edict of
Pacification, which is the seal of public faith, under whose benign
influence peace and quiet have been restored." And referring to Coligny's
arrival, he added: "You know that experience is dearly bought and is
worth much. I must therefore tell you that the chief result which I hoped
from his coming begins already to develop, inasmuch as the greater part
of my subjects, who lately lived in some distrust, have by this
demonstration gained such assurance of my kindness and affection, that
all partisan feeling and faction are visibly beginning to fade
away."<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposed marriage of Henry of Navarre and the king's sister.</div>

<p>Besides the Flemish project, an important domestic affair engaged the
attention of the king and his counsellors at the time of Coligny's visit.
This was the proposed marriage of young Henry, the Prince of Béarn, and
after his mother's death heir of the crown of Navarre, to Margaret of
Valois, the youngest sister of Charles the Ninth. Margaret, who had
lately entered upon her twen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>tieth year, was a year and a half older than
the prince.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> In a court and a state of society where the birth of a
daughter was the signal for the initiation of an unlimited number of
matrimonial projects, it is not surprising that this match, among many
others, was talked of in the very infancy of the parties, perhaps with
little expectation that anything would ever come of it. The prince was a
sprightly boy, and, it is said, so delighted his namesake, Henry the
Second, that the monarch playfully asked him whether he would like to be
his son-in-law&mdash;a question which the boy found no difficulty in answering
in the affirmative. In fact, the matter went so far that, when the young
Bearnese was little over three years of age, Antoine of Bourbon wrote to
his sister, the Duchess of Nevers, with undisguised delight, of "the
favor the king has been pleased to show me by the agreement between us
for the marriage of Madam Margaret, his daughter, with my eldest son&mdash;a
thing which I accept as so particular a token of his good grace, that I
am now at rest and satisfied with what I could most ardently desire in
this world."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> But the boy's mother had not been inclined to accept
the king's offer to take and educate him with his own children.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> She
was not very familiar with the disorders of the royal court; but she had
seen enough to convince her that the quiet plains at the foot of the
Pyrenees could furnish a safer school of manners and morals. More than
once the idea of the connection between the crowns of France and Navarre
was revived, and in 1562 Catharine bethought herself of it as a means of
detaching the unfortunate Antoine from the triumvirs, whose cause he had
espoused with such strange in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>fatuation.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> But other plans soon
diverted the ambitious mind of the Italian queen. Moreover, the civil
wars between Protestants and Roman Catholics made the marriage of the
daughter of the "Very Christian King" to the son of the most obstinate
Huguenot in France appear to be out of the range of propriety or
likelihood. Meantime, Margaret's union with Sebastian of Portugal was
seriously discussed.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> The tiresome negotiations ended in January,
1571, with a haughty refusal of her hand, dictated, as we have seen, by
Philip himself. A few weeks later, as Margaret informs us in her
Mémoires&mdash;which may generally be credited, except where the fair author's
love affairs are concerned&mdash;the Prince of Navarre began again to be
mentioned as an available candidate for her hand. She expressly states
that it was from the Montmorencies that the first suggestion
came<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>&mdash;that is, from François de Montmorency, the constable's oldest
son. This nobleman, while he had inherited a great part of his father's
influence, as the head of one of the most honorable feudal families in
France, having its seat in the very neighborhood of the capital, had
ranged himself with the party opposed to that with which Anne had been
identified, and, although in outward profession a Roman Catholic, was in
full sympathy with the liberal political views of his cousin, Admiral
Coligny. This fact effectually disposes of the story that the marriage
was proposed, however much it may subsequently have been entertained, as
a trap to ensnare the Huguenots, thus thrown off their guard.</p>

<p>Marshal Biron, another statesman of the same type, was the messenger to
carry the royal proposals to La Rochelle. He pictured to the Queen of
Navarre in glowing colors the advantages that would flow from this
alliance, the strength it would impart to the friends of mutual
toleration, the consternation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> and dismay it would carry into the camp of
the enemy. At the same time he declared that Charles the Ninth felt
confident that, although he had not as yet obtained from the Pope the
dispensation which the relationship subsisting between the parties, as
well as their religious differences, rendered necessary, Pius the Fifth
would ultimately place no obstacle in the way. Jeanne d'Albret gratefully
acknowledged the honor offered by the king to her son, but, before
accepting it, professed herself compelled to consult her spiritual
advisers respecting the question whether such a marriage might in good
conscience be entered into by a member of the reformed church.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> As
for Margaret herself, she gives us in her Mémoires little light as to the
state of her own feelings at this time. If we may imagine her so
indifferent, she demurely expressed her acquiescence in whatever her
mother might decide, but begged her to remember that "she was very
Catholic," and that "she would be very sorry to marry any one who was not
of her religion."<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> A few months later, however, when the prospects of
the marriage became less bright, because of the difficulties arising from
religion, it would seem that, with a perversity not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
unexampled, Margaret became more anxious to have it consummated. At
least, Francis Walsingham writes to Lord Burleigh: "The gentlewoman,
being most desirous thereof, falleth to reading of the Bible, and to the
use of the prayers used by them of the religion."<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Anjou match abandoned.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the project of a marriage between Elizabeth and Anjou had, as
we have seen, been virtually abandoned. The matter of religion was the
ostensible stumbling-block; it can scarcely have been the real difficulty
on either side. As to Anjou, the sincerity of his religious convictions
is certainly not above suspicion. But he was the head of a party in his
brother's kingdom, a party that professed unalterable devotion to the
"Holy See" and the old faith. If the eternal rewards of his fidelity to
the papacy were at all problematical, there was no doubt whatever in his
mind of the advantage of so powerful support as that which the
ecclesiastics of France could give him. He was resolved not to throw away
this advantage by openly agreeing to renounce all exercise of his own
religion in England, and this, too, without the certainty that the
concession would secure to him the hand of the queen. And, unfortunately,
it was impossible for him to gain this certainty. Elizabeth was already
pretty well understood. Her fancies and freaks it was beyond the power of
the most astute of her ministers to predict or to comprehend. If the
barrier of religion were demolished, there was no possibility of telling
what more formidable works might be unmasked. And so Henry, rather more
sensible upon this point than even Catharine and Charles, who would have
had him shrink from no concessions, made a virtue of necessity,
definitely withdrew from competition for the hand of a woman for whose
personal appearance it was impossible for him to entertain any
admiration; whose moral character, he had often been told and he more
than half suspected, was bad;<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> and told his friends, and probably
believed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span> that he had had a narrow escape. The queen, on the other hand,
was perhaps not conscious of insincerity of purpose. She must marry, if
not from inclination, for protection's sake&mdash;the protection of her
subjects and herself&mdash;so all the world told her; and a marriage that
would secure to England the support of France against Spain was the best.
But that she sought excuses for not taking the Duke of Anjou is evident,
even though she strove to make it appear to others, as well as to
herself, that the refusal came at last from him.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> And she had her
advisers&mdash;subjects who in secret aspired to her hand, or others&mdash;who, in
an underhand way, stimulated her aversion to Henry. It is not unlikely
that the Earl of Leicester, despite his ardent protestations of zealous
support of the match, was the most insidious of its opponents. "While
'the poor Huguenots' were telling Walsingham in tears that an affront
from England would bring back the Guises, and end in a massacre of
themselves, Leicester was working privately upon the queen, who was but
too willing to listen to him, feeding her through the ladies of the
bedchamber with stories that Anjou was infected with a loathsome disease,
and assisting his Penelope to unravel at night the web which she had
woven under Cecil's direction in the day."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The praise of Alençon.</div>

<p>So the negotiation of a marriage between Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of
Anjou, after being virtually dead for about a half-year, breathed its
last in January, 1572. But the full accord between the two kingdoms was
too important to the interests of both, and the opportunity of obtaining
a crown for one of her sons too precious in the eye of Catharine.
Accordingly the discussion of the terms of the treaty of amity was
pressed with still greater zeal, while the French envoy to England was
instructed to offer Alençon to Elizabeth in place of his brother. And now
were the wits of the statesmen on both sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> channel exercised to
find good reasons why the match would be no incongruous one.
Unfortunately, Alençon, as already stated, was short even for his age;
but this was no insuperable obstacle. "Nay," said Catharine de' Medici to
Sir Thomas Smith, when she was sounding him respecting his mistress's
disposition, "he is not so little; he is so high as you, or very near."
"For that matter, madam," replied Smith, "I for my part make small
account, if the queen's majestie can fancie him. For <i>Pipinus Brevis</i>,
who married <i>Bertha</i>, the King of Almain's daughter, was so little to
her, that he is standing in Aquisgrave, or Moguerre, a church in Almain,
she taking him by the hand, and his head not reaching to her girdle; and
yet he had by her Charlemain, the great Emperor and King of France, which
is reported to be almost a giant's stature."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> It was not so easy to
dispose of the disparity in years,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> and perhaps still less of
Alençon's disfigurement by small-pox; for that unlucky prince added this
to the long catalogue of his misfortunes. The course of the treaty for
mutual defence was, happily, somewhat smoother than that of the
matchmaking. On the eighteenth of April the treaty was formally
concluded,<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> and shortly after, Marshal Montmorency and M. de Foix
were despatched to administer the oath to Queen Elizabeth. This solemn
ceremony was performed on Sunday, the fifteenth of June. The deputies
were received with every mark of distinction, and the marshal was
publicly presented by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> queen with the insignia of the Order of the
Garter.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> The commission of the French envoys instructed them to press
upon Elizabeth the Alençon marriage as a powerful means of cementing the
alliance; and it empowered them to expend money to the extent of ten or
twelve thousand crowns in buying the consent of those lords who had
hitherto opposed the union. The Earl of Leicester, whose
straightforwardness may have been suspected, was to be tempted by the
special offer of some French heiress in marriage, the name of
Mademoiselle de Bourbon being suggested.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> But the marriage was not
destined to be accomplished, although the negotiations were kept up until
the very time of the massacre, and Elizabeth sent to Catharine de' Medici
her hearty acknowledgment of the honor she had done her <i>in offering her
all her sons successively</i>.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> At the very moment when the fearful blow
fell which was to render any such marriage impossible, Catharine was
planning and proposing an interview between Elizabeth on the one side,
and herself and Alençon on the other. That the dignity of neither party
might be compromised, it was suggested that the meeting might take place
some calm day on the water between Dover and Boulogne.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> Elizabeth had
reconsidered her partial refusal, and encouraged the project; the nobles,
the ladies of the court, the council, all favored it; and in a letter
written four days after the streets of Paris flowed with blood, but
before the appalling intelligence had reached him, the French ambassador
wrote to Catharine: "All who are well affected cry to us, 'Let my Lord
the Duke come!'"<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope Pius the Fifth alarmed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Cardinal of Alessandria sent to Paris.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's assurances.</div>

<p>It cannot be supposed that such a leaning could be manifested toward the
Huguenot party, and such amity concluded with the Protestant kingdom of
England, without arousing grave soli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>citude on the part of the Pope and
other Roman Catholic sovereigns of Europe. Pius the Fifth determined, if
possible, to deter Charles from permitting the hateful marriage between
his sister and the heretical Prince of Navarre. He therefore promptly
despatched his nephew, the Cardinal of Alessandria,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> first to
Sebastian of Portugal, whom he found no great difficulty in persuading
again to entertain the project of a marriage with Margaret of Valois, and
thence, with the utmost haste, to the court of Charles the Ninth.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
The legate, when admitted to an audience, unfolded at great length the
grievances of the pontiff&mdash;the mission of a heretic, formerly a bishop,
as envoy to Constantinople, the rumored opposition of the king to the
Holy League against the Turk, but especially the contemplated nuptials of
a daughter of France with the son of Jeanne d'Albret. Charles replied to
these charges in the most politic manner. He prayed that the earth might
open and swallow him up, rather than that he should stand in the way of
so illustrious and holy league as that against the infidel. As to his
zeal for the Christian faith, he demonstrated it&mdash;albeit some might
object that the fraternal affection which was reported to subsist between
the parties hardly rendered this argument convincing&mdash;by the fact of his
having exposed, in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> defence, his dearest brother, the Duke of Anjou,
to all the perils of war. By civil war the resources of his kingdom had
been so weakened that they barely sufficed for its protection. He
justified the Navarrese marriage by alleging the remarkable traits which
made Henry superior to any other prince of the Bourbon family, and by the
great benefit which religion would gain from his conversion. In short,
Charles was profuse in protestations of his sincere determination to
maintain the Catholic faith; and, drawing a valuable diamond ring from
his finger, he presented it to the legate as a pledge, he said, of his
unalterable fidelity to the Holy See, and a token that he would more than
redeem his promises. The cardinal legate, however, declined to receive
the gift, saying that he was amply satisfied with the plighted word of so
great a king, a security more firm than any other pledge that could be
given to him.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> Such seem to have been the assurances given by Charles
on this celebrated occasion, vague and indefinite, but calculated to
allay to a certain extent the anxiety of the head of the papal
church.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> There is good reason to believe that the king's intention of
fulfilling them, not to say his plan for doing so, was equally undefined;
although, so far as his own faith was concerned, he had no thought of
abandoning the church of his fathers. The expressions by means of which
Charles is made to point with unmistakable clearness to a contemplated
massacre,<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> of which, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>ever the case may stand with respect to his
mother, it is all but certain that he had at this time no idea, can only
be regarded as fabulous additions of which the earliest disseminators of
the story were altogether ignorant. The fact that the cardinal legate's
rejection of the ring was publicly known<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> seems to be a sufficient
proof that it was offered simply as a pledge of the king's general
fidelity to the Holy See, not of his intention to violate his edict and
murder his Protestant subjects. The government made the attempt in like
manner to quiet the people, whom even the smallest amount of concession
and favor to the Huguenots rendered suspicious; and the words uttered
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span> this purpose were often so flattering to the Roman Catholics, that,
in the light of subsequent events, they seem to have a reference to acts
of treachery to which they were not intended to apply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jeanne d'Albret becomes more favorable to her son's marriage.</div>

<p>The doubt propounded by Jeanne d'Albret to the reformed ministers,
respecting the lawfulness of a mixed marriage, having been satisfactorily
answered, and the devout queen being convinced that the union of Henry
and Margaret would rather tend to advance the cause to which she
subordinated all her personal interests, than retard it by casting
reproach upon it, the project was more warmly entertained on both sides.
Yet the subject was not without serious difficulty. Of this the religious
question was the great cause. To the English ambassadors, Walsingham and
Smith, Jeanne declared (on the fourth of March, 1572) in her own forcible
language, "that now she had the wolf by the ears, for that, in concluding
or not concluding the marriage, she saw danger every way; and that no
matter (though she had dealt in matters of consequence) did so much
trouble her as this, for that she could not tell how to resolve." She
could neither bring herself to consent that her son with his bride should
reside at the royal court without any exercise of his own religion&mdash;a
course which would not only tend to make him an atheist, but cut off all
hope of the conversion of his wife&mdash;nor that Margaret of Valois should be
guaranteed the permission to have mass celebrated whenever she came into
Jeanne's own domains in Béarn, a district which the queen "had cleansed
of all idolatry." For Margaret would by her example undo much of that
which had been so assiduously labored for, and the Roman Catholics who
had remained would become "more unwilling to hear the Gospel, they having
a staff to lean to."<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Her solicitude.</div>

<p>It was this uncertainty about Margaret's course, and the consequent gain
or loss to the Protestant faith, that rendered it almost impossible for
Jeanne d'Albret to master her anxiety. "In view," she wrote to her son,
"of Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>garet's judgment and the credit she enjoys with the queen her
mother and the king and her brothers, if she embrace 'the religion,' I
can say that we are the most happy people in the world, and not only our
house but all the kingdom of France will share in this happiness.... If
she remain obstinate in her religion, being devoted to it, as she is said
to be, it cannot be but that this marriage will prove the ruin, first, of
our friends and our lands, and such a support to the papists that, with
the good-will the queen mother bears us, we shall be ruined with the
churches of France." It would almost seem that a prophetic glimpse of the
future had been accorded to the Queen of Navarre. "My son, if ever you
prayed God, do so now, I beg you, as I pray without ceasing, that He may
assist me in this negotiation, and that this marriage may not be made in
His anger for our punishment, but in His mercy for His own glory and our
quiet."<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>But there were other grounds for solicitude. Catharine de' Medici was the
same deceitful woman she had always been. She would not allow Jeanne
d'Albret to see either Charles or Margaret, save in her presence. She
misrepresented the queen's words, and, when called to an account, denied
the report with the greatest effrontery. She destroyed all the hopes
Jeanne had entertained of frank discussion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen of Navarre is treated with tantalizing insincerity.</div>

<p>"You have great reason to pity me," the Queen of Navarre wrote to her
faithful subject in Béarn, "for never was I so disdainfully treated at
court as I now am.... Everything that had been announced to me is
changed. They wish to destroy all the hopes with which they brought
me."<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> Catharine showed no shame when detected in open falsehood. She
told Jeanne d'Albret that her son's governor had given her reason to
expect that Henry would consent to be married by proxy according to the
Romish ceremonial. But when she was hard pressed and saw that Jeanne did
not believe her, she coolly rejoined: "Well, at any rate, he told me
something." "I am quite sure of it, madam, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> something that did
not approach that!" "Thereupon," writes Jeanne in despair, "she burst out
laughing; for, observe, she never speaks to me without trifling."<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">She is shocked at the morals of the court.</div>

<p>But it was particularly the abominable immorality of the royal court that
alarmed the Queen of Navarre for the safety of her only son, should he be
called to sojourn there. The lady Margaret, she wrote&mdash;and her words
deserve the more notice on account of the infamy into which the life as
yet apparently so guileless was to lead&mdash;"is handsome, modest, and
graceful; but nurtured in the most wicked and corrupt society that ever
was. I have not seen a person who does not show the effects of it. Your
cousin, the marquise, is so changed in consequence of it, that there is
no appearance of religion, save that she does not go to mass; for, as for
her mode of life, excepting idolatry, she acts like the papists, and my
sister the princess still worse.... I would not for the world that you
were here to live. It is on this account that I want you to marry, and
your wife and you to come out of this corruption; for although I believed
it to be very great, I find it still greater. Here it is not the men that
solicit the women, but the women the men. Were you here, you would never
escape but by a remarkable exercise of God's mercy.... I abide by my
first opinion, that you must return to Béarn. My son, you can but have
judged from my former letters, that they only try to separate you from
God and from me; you will come to the same conclusion from this last, as
well as form some idea respecting the anxiety I am in on your account. I
beg you to pray earnestly to God; for you have great need of His help at
all times, and above all at this time. I pray to Him that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> may obtain
it, that He may give you, my son, all your desires."<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Jeanne d'Albret, June 9, 1572.</div>

<p>Such were the anxieties of the Queen of Navarre in behalf of a son whom
she had carefully reared, hoping to see in him a pillar of the Protestant
faith. She was to be spared the sight both of those scenes in his life
which might have flushed her cheek with pride, and of other scenes which
would have caused her to blush with shame. At length the last
difficulties in the way of Henry of Navarre's marriage, so far as the
court and the queen were concerned, were removed.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Charles and
Catharine no longer insisted that Margaret should be allowed the mass
when in Béarn; while Jeanne reluctantly abandoned her objections to the
celebration of the marriage ceremony in the city of Paris. Accordingly,
about the middle of May the Queen of Navarre left Blois and came to the
capital for the purpose of devoting her attention to the final
arrangements for the wedding. She had not, however, been long in Paris
before she fell sick of a violent fever, to which it became evident that
she must succumb. We are told by a writer who regards this as a manifest
provocation of Heaven, that one of her last acts before her sudden
illness had been a visit to the Louvre to petition the king that, on the
approaching festival of Corpus Christi (Fête-Dieu), the "idol," as she
styled the wafer, might not be borne in solemn procession past the house
in which she lodged; and that the king had granted her request.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
During the short interval before her death she exhibited the same
devotion as previously to the purer Christianity she had embraced,
mingled with affectionate solicitude for her son and daughter, so soon to
be left orphans. Her constancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> and fortitude proved her worthy of all
the eulogies that were lavished upon her.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> On Monday, the ninth of
June, she died, sincerely mourned by the Huguenots, who felt that in her
they had lost one of their most able and efficient supports, the weakness
of whose sex had not made her inferior to the most active and resolute
man of the party. Even Catharine de' Medici, who had hated her with all
her cowardly heart, made some show of admiring her virtues, now that she
was no longer formidable and her straightforward policy had ceased to
thwart the underhanded and shifting diplomacy in which the queen mother
delighted. Yet the report gained currency that Jeanne had been poisoned
at Catharine's instigation. She had, it was said, bought gloves of
Monsieur René, the queen mother's perfumer<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>&mdash;a man who boasted of his
acquaintance with the Italian art of poisoning&mdash;and had almost instantly
felt the effects of some subtle powder with which they were impregnated.
To contradict this and other sinister stories, the king ordered an
examination of her remains to be made; but no corroborative evidence was
discovered. It is true that the physicians are said to have avoided,
ostensibly through motives of humanity, any dissection of the brain,
where alone the evidence could have been found.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> Be this as it may,
the charge of poisoning is met so uniformly in the literature of the
sixteenth century, on occasion of every sudden death, that the most
credulous reader becomes sceptical as to its truth, and prefers to
indulge the hope that perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> age may not have been quite so bad as
it was represented by contemporaries.</p>

<p>The Prince of Béarn now became King of Navarre; and, as the court went
into mourning for the deceased queen, his nuptials with Margaret of
Valois were deferred until the month of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny and the boy king.</div>

<p>Admiral Coligny, instead of returning to La Rochelle after his friendly
reception at the court at Blois, had gone to Châtillon, where his ruined
country-seat and devastated plantations had great need of his
presence.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> Here he was soon afterward joined by his wife, travelling
from La Rochelle with a special safe-conduct from the king, the preamble
of which declared Charles's will and intention to retain Coligny near his
own person, "in order to make use of him in his most grave and important
affairs, as a worthy minister, whose virtue is sufficiently known and
tried."<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Coligny was not left long in his rural retirement. Charles
expressed, and probably felt, profound disgust with his former advisers,
and knew not whom to trust. On one occasion, about this time, he held a
conversation with Téligny respecting the Flemish war. Téligny had just
entreated his Majesty not to mention to the queen mother the details into
which he entered&mdash;a promise which Charles readily gave, and swore with
his ordinary profanity to observe. And then the poor young king, with a
desperation which must enlist our sympathy in his behalf, undertook to
explain to Coligny's son-in-law his own solitude in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> midst of a
crowded court. There was no one, he said, upon whom he could rely for
sound counsel, or for the execution of his plans. Tavannes was prudent,
indeed; but, having been Anjou's lieutenant, and almost the author of his
victories, would oppose a war that threatened to obscure his laurels.
Vieilleville was wedded to his cups. Cossé was avaricious, and would sell
all his friends for ten crowns. Montmorency alone was good and
trustworthy, but so given to the pleasures of the chase that he would be
sure to be absent at the very moment his help was indispensable.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> It
is not strange, under these circumstances, that Charles should have
turned with sincere respect, and almost with a kind of affection, to that
stern old Huguenot warrior, upright, honorable, pious, a master of the
art of war, never more to be dreaded than after the reverses which he
accepted as lessons from a Father's hands.</p>

<p>As for Coligny himself, his task was not one of his own seeking. But he
pitied from his heart the boy-king&mdash;still more boyish in character than
in years&mdash;as he pitied and loved France. Above all, he was unwilling to
omit anything that might be vitally important for the progress of the
Gospel in his native land and abroad. His eyes were not blind to his
danger. When, at the king's request, he came to Paris, he received
letters of remonstrance for his imprudence, from all parts of France. He
was reminded that other monarchs before Charles had broken their pledges.
Huss had been burned at Constance notwithstanding the emperor's safe
conduct, and the maxim that no faith need be kept with heretics had
obtained a mournful currency.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> To these warnings Admiral Coligny
replied at one moment with some annoyance, indignant that his young
sovereign should be so suspected; at another, with more calmness,
magnanimously dismissing all solicitude for himself in comparison with
the great ends he had in view. When he was urged to consider that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> other
Huguenots, less hated by the papists than he was, had been treacherously
assassinated&mdash;as was the general opinion then&mdash;Andelot, Cardinal
Châtillon, and lately the Queen of Navarre&mdash;his reply was still the same:
"I am well aware that it is against me principally that the enmity is
directed. And yet how great a misfortune will it be for France, if, for
the sake of my individual preservation, she must be kept in perpetual
alarm and be plunged on every occasion into new troubles! Or, what
benefit will it be to me to live thus in continual distrust of the king?
If my prince wishes to slay me, he can accomplish his will in any part of
the realm. As a royal officer, I cannot in honor refuse to comply with
the summons of the king, meantime committing myself to the providence of
Him who holds in his hand the hearts of kings and princes, and has
numbered my years&mdash;nay, the very hairs of my head. If I succeed in going
in arms to the Low Countries, I hope that I may do signal service, and
change hatred into good-will. But, if I fall there, at least the enmity
against me will cease, and perhaps men will live in peace, without its
being needful to set a whole world in commotion for the protection of the
life of a single man."<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The dispensation delayed.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king's earnestness.</div>

<p>The juncture was critical, although the future still looked auspicious.
Charles was resolved that the marriage of his sister should go forward,
and seemed almost as resolute, when he had thus secured peace at home
between Papist and Huguenot, to embark in a war against Spain&mdash;the
natural enemy of French repose and greatness. Gregory the Thirteenth&mdash;for
Pius the Fifth had died on the first of May, 1572, although his maxims
and his counsels were unhappily still alive, and endowed with a
mischievous activity&mdash;refused to grant the dispensation for the marriage
except on impossible conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> But Charles was too impatient to
await his caprice. "My dear aunt," he once said to the Queen of Navarre,
a short time before her death, "I honor you more than the Pope, and I
love my sister more than I fear him. I am not indeed a Huguenot, but
neither am I a blockhead; and if the Pope play the fool too much, I will
myself take Margot," his common nickname for his sister, "by the hand,
and give her away in marriage in full prêche."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

<p>Charles was apparently equally in earnest in his intention to maintain
his edict for the advantage of the Huguenots. Accordingly he published a
new declaration to this effect, and sent it to his governors, accompanied
with a letter expressive of his great gratification that the spirit of
distrust was everywhere giving place to confidence, a proof of which was
to be found in the recent restitution of the four cities of La Rochelle,
Montauban, La Charité, and Cognac, by those in whose hands they were
intrusted by the edict of St. Germain.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> And Charles's correspondence
shows still further that the projects urged by Coligny, Louis of Nassau,
and other prominent patriots, had made a deep impression upon his
imagination, now that for the first time the prospect of a truly noble
campaign opened before him. In carrying out the extensive plan against
the Spanish king, it was indispensable&mdash;so thought the wisest politicians
of the time&mdash;to secure the co-operation of the Turk. The extent of
Philip's dominions in the Old and the New World, the prestige of his
successes, the enormous treasure he was said to derive yearly from his
colonial establishments in the Indies, all gave him a reputation for
power which a more critical examination would have dissipated; but the
time for this had not yet arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> Consequently Charles had sent his
ambassador to Constantinople, intending through him to conclude an
alliance offensive and defensive with the Moslems. And his declarations
to the half-Protestant prelate were explicit enough: "All my humors
conspire to make me oppose the greatness of the Spaniards, and I am
deliberating how I may therein conduct myself the most skilfully that I
can."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> "I have concluded a league with the Queen of England&mdash;a
circumstance which, with the understanding I have with the Princes of
Germany, puts the Spaniards in a wonderful jealousy."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> Not only so,
but he instructs the ambassador to inform the Grand Seignior that he has
a large number of vessels ready, with twelve or fifteen thousand troops
about to embark, ostensibly to protect his own harbors, "but in reality
intended to keep the Catholic king uneasy, and to give boldness to those
Beggars of the Netherlands to bestir themselves and form such enterprises
as they already have done."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> If these assurances had been addressed
to a Protestant prince, it would readily be comprehended that they might
have had for their object to lull his co-religionists into a fatal
security. But, as they were intended only for a Mohammedan ruler, I can
see no room for the suspicion that Charles was at this time animated by
anything else than an unfeigned desire to realize the plan of Coligny, of
a confederacy that should shatter the much-vaunted empire of Philip the
Second.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mons and Valenciennes captured.</div>

<p>An event now occurred which for a time raised high the hopes of the
French Huguenots. This was the capture of the important cities of Mons
and Valenciennes. To Count Louis of Nassau the credit of this bold and
successful stroke was due. With the secret connivance of Charles, he had
recruited in France a body of five hundred horsemen and a thousand foot
soldiers, among whom, as was natural, the Huguenot element predominated.
With these he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> now set foot again in the Netherlands. The success that
first attended his enterprise was owing, however, rather to a well
executed trick than to any practical exhibition of generalship; for the
gates of Mons were opened from within by a party that had entered on the
previous day in the disguise of wine-merchants.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> Nevertheless the
capture of Mons, the capital of the province of Hainault (on Saturday,
the twenty-fourth of May), was so brilliant an exploit, coming as it did
close upon the heels of other reverses of the Duke of Alva, that the
French Huguenots and all who sympathized with them may be pardoned for
having indulged even in somewhat extravagant demonstrations of joy. They
seem to have believed that it was pretty nearly over with that hated
instrument of Spanish tyranny. They fancied that, with his five hundred
horse, Louis might penetrate the country by a rapid movement, and either
take Alva prisoner, or, if the duke should retire to Antwerp, raise the
whole country in revolt.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's indecision.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Queen Elizabeth inspires no confidence.</div>

<p>For the next two months the Huguenot leaders were indefatigable in their
efforts to persuade Charles to take open and decided ground against
Spain; but they were met by Anjou and the party in his interest with
arguments drawn from the difficulty or injustice of the undertaking, and
by the suggestion that Elizabeth, as was her wont, would be likely to
withdraw so soon as she saw France once engaged in war with her powerful
neighbor, and to use Charles's embarrassments as a means of securing
private advantages. In point of fact, Charles was personally unwilling to
commit himself until sure of England's support. Meanwhile, Catharine,
from whose Argus-eyed inspection nothing that was debated in the royal
presence, openly or secretly, ever escaped notice, awaited with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> her
accustomed irresolution Elizabeth's decision, before herself deciding
whether to throw her influence into the scale with Coligny (of whose
growing favor with her son she had begun to entertain some suspicion), or
with Anjou and the Spaniards. But Elizabeth was as ever a riddle, not
only to her allies, but even to her most confidential advisers. Certainly
she was no friend to Philip and Alva; yet she would not abruptly enter
into war against them. She could not help seeing that the interests of
her person and of her kingdom, to say nothing of her Protestant faith,
were bound up in the success of the Prince of Orange, who was about to
cross the Rhine with twenty-five thousand Germans for the relief of Mons,
now invested by Alva. For the duke wisely regarded the recapture of this
place as the first step in extricating himself from his present
embarrassments. In such a strife as that upon which Elizabeth must before
long enter, whether with or without her consent, the cordial alliance of
France would be valuable beyond computation. And yet, with a fatal
perversity, she dallied with the proposal of marriage. One day she would
not hear of Alençon, alleging that his age and personal blemishes placed
the matter out of all consideration. On another she gave hopes, and
agreed to take a month's consideration.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> Thus she tantalized her
suitor. Thus she convinced the cunning Italian woman who, although she
made no present show of holding the reins of power in France, was ready
at any moment to resume them, that there was no reliance to be placed on
England's promise of support against Philip.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rout of Genlis.</div>

<p>The golden opportunity was in truth fast slipping away. Alva had struck
promptly at that opponent whose thrust was likely to be most deadly. Mons
must soon fall. A French Huguenot force, under command of Jean de
Hangest, Sieur de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span> Genlis, was sent forward to relieve it. But the
Frenchman was no match for the cooler prudence of his antagonist,<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
and suffered himself, on the march, to be surprised (on the nineteenth of
July) and taken prisoner by Don Frederick of Toledo and Chiappin Vitelli.
Of his army, barely one hundred foot soldiers found their way into the
beleaguered town. Twelve hundred were killed on the field of
battle&mdash;almost in sight of Mons&mdash;and a much larger number butchered by
the peasantry of the neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> A handful of officers and men,
scarcely more fortunate, shared the captivity of their commander, and
were destined to have their fortunes depend for a considerable time upon
the fluctuating interests of two unprincipled courts.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>The rout of Genlis was not in itself a decisive event. While Coligny
could bring forward a far more numerous army, and Orange was in command
of a considerable German force, the loss of this small detachment was but
one of those many reverses that are to be looked for in every war. But,
happening under the peculiar circumstances of the hour, it was invested
with a consequence disproportioned to its real importance. The fate of
the French Huguenots was quivering in the balance. The papal party was
known to be bitterly opposed to the war against Spain, and to be merely
awaiting an opportunity to strike a deadly blow at the heretics whom the
royal edict still protected. Catharine was undecided; but, with her,
indecision was the ordinary prelude to the sudden adoption of some one of
many conflicting projects, which had been long brooded over, but between
which the choice was, in the end, the result rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span> of accident,
caprice, or temporary impressions, than of calm deliberation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It determines Catharine to take the Spanish side.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of the golden opportunity.</div>

<p>This reverse at Mons, limited in its extent as it was, would be likely,
so the Huguenot leaders of France foresaw&mdash;and they were not mistaken&mdash;to
determine Catharine to take the Spanish side. With the queen mother in
favor of Spain and intolerance, experience had taught them that there was
little to expect from her weak son's intentions, however good they might
be. The only ground of hope for Orange and the Netherlands, and the only
prospect for security and religious toleration at home, lay in the
success of the Flemish project at Paris; and of this but a single chance
seemed to remain&mdash;in Elizabeth's finally espousing their cause with some
good degree of resolution. "Such of the religion," wrote Walsingham to
Lord Burleigh, inclosing the particulars of the disaster of Genlis, "as
before slept in security, begin now to awake and to see their danger, and
do therefore conclude that, unless this enterprise in the Low Countries
have good success, their cause groweth desperate."<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> To the Earl of
Leicester Walsingham was still more explicit in his warnings: "The
gentlemen of the religion, since the late overthrow of Genlis, weighing
what dependeth upon the Prince of Orange's overthrow, have made
demonstration to the king, that, his enterprise lacking good success, it
shall not then lie in his power to maintain his edict. They therefore
desire him to weigh whether it were better to have foreign war with
advantage, or inward war to the ruin of himself and his estate.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> The
king being not here, his answer is not yet received. They hope to receive
some such resolution as the danger of the cause requireth. In the
mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>time, the marshal (Montmorency) desired me to move your lordship to
deal with her Majesty to know whether she, upon overture to be made to
the king, cannot be content to join with him in assistance of this poor
prince." And the faithful ambassador did not forget to remind his
mistress that the success of Philip in Flanders was still more dangerous
for Elizabeth than for Charles.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The admiral retains his courage.</div>

<p>Meantime, Admiral Coligny, although disappointed at the rout of the
vanguard of the expedition which was to have been fitted out for the
liberation of the Netherlands, and yet more at the coolness which it had
occasioned among those who up to this moment had been not unfriendly, did
not yield to despondency, but labored all the more strenuously to engage
Charles in an undertaking fitted to call forth the nobler faculties of
his soul, and to free him from the thraldom under narrow-minded and
interested counsellors to which he had been subject all his life long.
Even before Genlis's defeat (in June, 1572), the admiral had presented an
extended paper, wherein the justice and the fair prospects of the war had
been set forth with rare force and cogency.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> It may be that now,
under the influence of a sincere and unselfish devotion that took no
account of personal risks, the admiral distinctly told his young master
that he could never be a king in the true sense until he should
emancipate himself from his mother's control, and until he should find,
outside of France, some occupation for his brother Henry of Anjou, such
as the vacancy of the Polish throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> seemed to offer.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> Such frankness
would have been patriotic and timely, although a politician, influenced
only by a regard for his own safety, would have regarded it as foolhardy
in the extreme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles and Catharine at Montpipeau.</div>

<p>This advice, promptly and faithfully reported to Catharine by the spies
she kept around the king's person,<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> was the last drop in the cup of
Coligny's offences. Charles, at the time of her discovery of this fact,
was absent from court, seeking a few days' recreation at Montpipeau.
Thither his mother, now really alarmed for the continuance of her
influence, pursued him in precipitate haste.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> Shutting herself up
with him apart from his followers, she burst into tears and plied Charles
with an artful harangue. For this woman, who had a masculine will and a
heart as cold and devoid of pity as the most utter scepticism could make
it, had the ability to counterfeit the feminine tenderness which she did
not possess. "I had not thought it possible," she said amid her sobs to
her son, who trembled like a culprit detected in his crime, "I had not
thought it possible that, in return for my pains in rearing you&mdash;in
return for my preservation of your crown, of which both Huguenots and
Catholics were desirous of robbing you, and after having sacrificed
myself and incurred such risks in your behalf, you would have been
willing to make me so miserable a requital. You hide yourself from me,
your mother, and take counsel of your enemies. You snatch yourself from
my arms that saved you, in order to rest in the arms of those who wished
to murder you. I know that you hold secret deliberations with the
admiral. You desire inconsiderately to plunge into a war with Spain, and
so to expose your kingdom, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> as yourself and us, a prey to 'those
of the religion.' If I am so miserable, before compelling me to witness
such a sight, give me permission to withdraw to my birthplace,<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> and
send away your brother, who may well style himself unfortunate in having
employed his life for the preservation of yours. Give him at least time
to get out of danger and from the presence of enemies made in your
service&mdash;the Huguenots, who do not wish for a war with Spain, but for a
French war and a subversion of all estates, which will enable them to
gain a secure footing."<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rumors of Elizabeth's desertion of her allies.</div>

<p>Such was a portion of the queen mother's crafty speech. But there was
another point upon which she doubtless touched, and which she used to no
little purpose. A report had reached her from England to the effect that
Queen Elizabeth had decided to issue a proclamation recalling the English
who had gone to Flushing to assist the patriots. The story was false; so
the secretary, Sir Thomas Smith, subsequently assured Walsingham.
Elizabeth neither had done so, nor intended anything of the kind.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a>
But it was wonderfully like the usual practice of Henry the Eighth's
daughter, and Catharine believed it, and looked with horror at the
precipice before which she stood. Deserted by her faithless ally, France
was entering single-handed a contest of life or death with the
world-empire of Spain. In fact, the English ambassador ascribed to the
receipt of this intelligence alone both the queen mother's tears and
entreaties at Montpipeau and the king's altered policy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> "Touching
Flemish matters," he wrote to Lord Burleigh, "the king had proceeded to
an open dealing, had he not received advertisement out of England, that
her Majesty meant to revoke such of her subjects as are presently in
Flanders; whereupon such of his council here as incline to Spain, have
put the queen mother in such a fear, that the enterprise cannot but
miscarry without the assistance of England, as she with tears had
dissuaded the king for the time, who otherwise was very resolute."<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p>Catharine had not mistaken her power over the feeble intellect and the
inconstant will of her son. Terrified less by the prospect of a Huguenot
supremacy which she held forth, than by the menace of her withdrawal and
that of Anjou, Charles, who was but too well acquainted with their
cunning and ambition, admitted his fault in concealing his plans, and
promised obedience for the future.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles thoroughly cast down.</div>

<p>It was a sore disappointment to Admiral Coligny. The young king had,
until this time, shown himself so favorable, that "commissions were
granted, ready to have been sealed, for the levying of men in sundry
provinces." But he had now lost all his enthusiasm, and spoke coldly of
the enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> Gaspard de Coligny did not, however, even now lose
courage or forsake the post of duty to which God and his country
evidently called him. In truth, the superiority of his mental and moral
constitution, less evident in prosperity, now became resplendent, and
chained the attention of every beholder. "How perplexed the admiral is,
who foreseeth the mischief that is like to follow, if assistance come
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> from above," wrote Walsingham, full of admiration, to the Earl of
Leicester, "your lordship may easily guess. And surely to say truth, he
never showed greater magnanimity, nor never was better followed nor more
honored of those of the religion than now he is, which doth not a little
appal the enemies. In this storm he doth not give over the helm. He
layeth before the king and his council the peril and danger of his
estate, and though he cannot obtain what he would, yet doth he obtain
somewhat from him."<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny partially succeeds in reassuring him.</div>

<p>So wrote that shrewd observer, Sir Francis Walsingham, just two weeks
before the bloody Sunday of the massacre, and eight days before the
marriage of Navarre, little suspecting, in spite of his anxiety, the
flood of misery which was so soon to burst upon that devoted land. To all
human foresight there was still hope that Charles, weak, nerveless,
addicted to pleasure, but not yet quite lost to a sense of honor, might
yet be induced to adopt a policy which would place France among the
foremost champions of intellectual and civil liberty, and transfer to the
north of the Pyrenees the prosperity which the Spanish monarchs had
misused and had employed only as an instrument of oppression and
degradation. And, indeed, Coligny was partially successful; for the
impression made upon Charles by his mother's complaints and menaces at
Montpipeau gradually wore away, and again he listened with apparent
interest to the manly arguments of the great Huguenot leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth toys with dishonorable proposals from Netherlands.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Fatal results.</div>

<p>Could Elizabeth at this moment have brought herself to a more noble
course, could she for once have forgotten to "deal under hand," and help
secretly while in public she disavowed&mdash;could she, in short, have
realized for a single instant her responsibility as a great Protestant
princess, and been willing to expose even her own life to peril in order
to secure to the Reformation a chance of fair play, it might not even now
have been too late. But what was she doing at this very moment? According
to the admission of her own secretary, she was engaged in detaining
volunteers from the Netherlands, on the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>text of "fearing too much
disorder there through lack of some good head;" and "gently answering
with a dilatory and doubtful answer" the Duke of Alva, when he demanded
the revocation of the queen's subjects in Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> Was she
projecting anything still more dishonorable? The Spanish envoy in
England, Anton de Guaras, affirms it, in a letter of the thirtieth of
June to the Duke of Alva; and we have no means of disproving his
assertions. In his account of a private audience granted him by Queen
Elizabeth, the ambassador writes: "She told me that emissaries were
coming every day from Flushing to her, proposing to place the town in her
hands. If it was for the service of his Majesty, and if his Majesty
approved, she said that she would accept their offer. With the English
who were already there, and with others whom she would send over for the
purpose, it would be easy for her to take entire possession of the place,
and she would then make it over to the Duke of Alva or to any one whom
the duke would appoint to receive it."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Guaras can scarcely be
suspected of misrepresenting the conversation upon so important a topic
and in a confidential communication to the Spanish Governor of the
Netherlands. The most charitable construction of Elizabeth's words seems
to be that they were a clumsy attempt to propitiate the duke "with a
dilatory answer," as Sir Thomas Smith somewhat euphemistically expresses
it, and that she had no intention of making good her engagements. But it
was a sad blunder on her part, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> likely to be ruinous to her friends,
the French Protestants. Alva was not slow in concluding that Elizabeth's
offer was of greater value as documentary proof of her untrustworthy
character, than as a means of recovering Flushing. "There is no positive
proof," remarks the historian to whom we are indebted for an acquaintance
with the letter of Guaras, "that Alva communicated Elizabeth's offers to
the queen mother and the King of France, but he was more foolish than he
gave the world reason to believe him to be if he let such a weapon lie
idle in his writing-desk."<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> And so that inconstant, unprincipled
Italian woman, on whose fickle purpose the fate of thousands was more
completely dependent than even her contemporaries as yet knew, at last
reached the definite persuasion that Elizabeth was preparing to play her
false, at the very moment when Coligny was hurrying her son into war with
Spain. Even if France should prove victorious, Catharine's own influence
would be thrown into perpetual eclipse by that of the admiral and his
associates. This result the queen mother resolved promptly to forestall,
and for that purpose fell back upon a scheme which had probably been long
floating dimly in her mind.</p>

<blockquote><div class="sidenote">Mémoires de Michel de la Huguerye.</div>

<p>The <i>Mémoires inédits de Michel de la Huguerye</i>, of which the
first volume was recently published (Paris, 1877), under the
auspices of the National Historical Society, present some
interesting points, and deserve a special reference. At first
sight, the disclosures, with which the author tells us he was
favored, would seem to establish the bad faith of the court in
entering upon the peace of St. Germain, and the long
premeditation of the succeeding massacre. A closer examination
of the facts, assuming La Huguerye's thorough veracity, shows
that this is a mistake. La Huguerye may, indeed, have been
informed by companions on the way to Italy, who supposed him
to be a partisan of the Guises, that a great blow would be
struck at the Huguenots when the proper time arrived; and La
Huguerye may have been confident that he was telling the
truth, when, about Martinmas (November 11th), 1570, he stated
to De Briquemault, that "the king, seeing that he could not
attain his object by way of arms without greatly
weakening&mdash;nay, endangering his kingdom, had resolved upon
taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> another road, by which, in a single day, he would
cleanse his whole state." He may have been assured, on what he
deemed good authority, that the Pope was in the plot, and
would keep the King of Spain from doing anything that might
interfere with the execution, and have inferred that, the
peace being a treacherous one, the only hope of the Huguenots
lay in skilfully enlisting Charles in its maintenance,
contrary to his original purpose. So he was confirmed in his
belief by the contents of the despatches of the Spanish
ambassador at the French court, treacherously submitted to the
Huguenots by an unfaithful agent of the envoy. But the former
statements were, at most, little better than rumors, to which
the circumstances of the hour gave color. The air was full of
dark hints; but, apparently, they had no more solid foundation
than the fact that, in an age abounding in perfidious schemes,
the Protestants had already placed themselves partially in the
power of their great enemies, and were likely soon to be more
completely in their hands. The information received by La
Huguerye was a very different thing from an authoritative
avowal of a concealed purpose made by Catharine or by Charles
himself. On the other hand, the assurances in the Spanish
despatches were just of the same general nature as others with
which the French government endeavored to quiet Philip, Alva,
and the Roman pontiff himself.</p>

<p>The only other peculiarity of La Huguerye to which I shall
allude is his studied misrepresentation of the character of
Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre. Contrary to the uniform
portraiture given by contemporaries of both religious parties,
she here appears as "an inconsiderate woman (femme légère),
with little forethought," "known to be jealous of the
authority of the admiral," "whom she thwarted by her authority
as much as was possible, at whatever cost or danger it might
be." She had "intermeddled with affairs in the last war,
unsolicited and of her own accord, not so much for conscience'
sake, as because of the hatred her house bore to the popes,
sole cause of the loss of the kingdom of Navarre, and
especially through jealousy of the late Prince of Condé, whom
she saw to be in the enjoyment of such credit, and to be so
well followed, that she suspected great injury might result to
her son in the event of his succession to the throne." She
was, consequently, "not very sorry" to hear of Condé's death
at Jarnac. Having been disappointed in securing for her son
the sole (nominal) command of the Huguenots, she vented her
vengeance upon Coligny, whom she held responsible for the
association of the young Condé in the leadership with his
cousin. From that time forward she took every opportunity to
cross the admiral, with the view of compelling him to retire
in disgust from the management of affairs. In one of the
speeches&mdash;Sallustian, I suspect&mdash;in which the Mémoires abound,
Count Louis of Nassau is represented as lamenting: "It is a
great pity to have to do with a woman who has no other counsel
than her own head, which is too little and light (légère) to
contain so many reasons and precautions, and who is of such
weight in matters of so great consequence. And the mischief is
that she has such an aversion to the admiral through foolish
jealousy," etc. At last the admiral is goaded on to
unpardonable imprudence. In the spring of 1572 he yields to
the importunities of Marshal Cossé, and goes from La Rochelle
to the royal court at Blois: "weary of being near this
princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> he exposed himself to the evident peril, of which
he had had advices and arguments enough."</p>

<p>To all this misrepresentation, the remarks of La Huguerye's
editor, the Baron de Ruble, are a sufficient answer: "No other
historian of the period, Catholic or Huguenot, has accused the
Queen of Navarre of so much jealousy, frivolity, and spite. To
the calumnies of La Huguerye we should oppose the verdict
which every impartial judge can pronounce respecting this
princess, in accordance with the letters published by the
Marquis de Rochambeau and the testimony of contemporaries." </p></blockquote>

published journal of La Fosse, Charles the Ninth expressed himself to the
preachers of Paris, who had come to remonstrate with him in language
which may at first sight appear somewhat suspicious: "attestant ledict
roy vouloir vivre et mourir en la religion de ses prédécesseurs roys,
religion catholique et romaine, toutefois qu'il avoit fait abattre la

plusieurs choses contre sa conscience, toutefois par contrainte à cause

(pp. 138, 139). There is good reason, however, to believe that the secret
reason which the king was unwilling to name was not a contemplated
massacre of the Protestants, but rather the Navarrese and English
marriages, and the war with Spain in the Netherlands.</p></div>

"granny"&mdash;"ceste vieille"&mdash;and administer to her, under some pretext, a
"French potion"&mdash;"un breuvage de France"&mdash;so as to become a widower
within six months of the wedding day. Then he might marry Mary, Queen of
Scots, and reign with her peaceably over the whole island! Correspondance

previously, I doubt whether she ever forgave the suggestion, or the fair

Rochelle, there had been held in this Huguenot asylum a convocation of
historical importance. The sessions of the seventh national synod,
lasting from the second to the eleventh of April, 1571, were consumed in
important deliberations respecting the doctrines and discipline of the
reformed church (see Aymon, Tous les synodes, i. 98-111). The Queen of
Navarre, the Princes of Navarre and Condé, Count Louis of Nassau, and
Admiral Coligny were present. At the request of the synod, they added
their signatures to those of the ministers and elders, upon three copies
of the Confession of Faith, engrossed on parchment, which were to be kept
at La Rochelle, in Béarn, and at Geneva respectively (see the eighth
general article). The moderator on this occasion was Theodore Beza, who
had been specially invited to France. The reformer was certainly not
destitute of courage, for he could not have forgotten the dangers to
which he had been exposed on previous visits to France. They were even
greater than Beza himself probably knew. In June, 1563, after the
conclusion of the first civil war, there was a rumor at Brussels that
Beza could not return to Geneva, because of a quarrel he had had with
Calvin. Thereupon, the Duchess of Parma, Regent of the Netherlands,
suspecting that he might be tempted to come through the Spanish
dominions, issued secret orders that the frontiers should be watched, and
offered a reward of one thousand florins to any one who should bring him,
dead or alive. He was described as "homme de moïenne stature, ayant barbe
à demy blanche, et le visage hault et large." Letters of the Duchess of
Parma, June 11th and 25th, 1563, <i>apud</i> Charles Paillard, Histoire des

maintained that she was only brought to consent by threats. "La reine fut

story that Margaret was averse to this marriage, because of a romantic
attachment to young Henry of Guise, is sufficiently clear from the
circumstance that the Duke of Guise had been married for some time when
the match between the Prince of Navarre and Margaret of Valois was first
talked of in earnest. He married, on the 17th of September, 1570,
Catharine of Cleves, widow of Prince Porcien. ("<i>Hodie</i> celebrantur
Lutetiæ Ducis Guisii, qui ducit in uxorem viduam principis Portiani,"
etc. Languet, Sept. 17, 1570, Epist. secr., i. 163.) It is not probable
that Margaret would object to the advantageous marriage with Henry of
Navarre on account of her affection for a former lover, who, at the time
of her nuptials, had been for two years married to another woman.</p></div>

should be alleged as casting some doubt upon this characteristic of his,
we must hasten to add that he did so, we are assured, only in consequence
of the urgent solicitations of Cardinal Farnese and others. He deserves
the credit, however, of yielding to their persuasions with reasonable
promptness, for the nomination of his nephew took place within two months
of the Pope's accession. Michael, being like his uncle a native of the

designation of "il cardinale Alessandrino," which Pius relinquished on

had a particular purpose in producing testimony to show that Charles IX.
<i>constrained</i> his sister to marry, as it would assist him in obtaining a
divorce for Henry IV. If, as D'Ossat affirms, the Cardinal of Alessandria
exclaimed, on hearing of the massacre, "God be praised! The King of

promises.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_879_879" id="Footnote_879_879"></a><a href="#FNanchor_879_879"><span class="label">[879]</span></a> "<i>The foolish cardinal</i>," wrote Sir Thomas Smith, English
ambassador at the French court during Walsingham's temporary absence
(March 3, 1571/2), "went away as wise as he came; he neither brake the
marriage with Navarre, nor got no dismes of the Church of France, nor
perswaded the King to enter into the League with the Turk, nor to accept
the Tridentine, or to break off Treaty with us; and <i>the foolishest part
of all, at his going away, he refused a diamond which the King offered
him of 600 crowns</i>, yet he was here highly feasted. He and his train cost
the King above 300 crowns a day, as they said." Digges, 193. Gabutius
adds that after the death of Pius V.&mdash;probably after the
massacre&mdash;Charles IX. sent the ring to the cardinal with this inscription
upon the bezel: "Non minus hæc solida est pietas, ne pietas possit mea
sanguine solvi." Vita Pii Quinti, <i>ubi supra</i>, § 246, p. 676. The
inscription had doubtless been cut since the first proffer of the ring.
It appears to me most probable that the ring was offered by Charles to
the cardinal with the idea that its acceptance would bind him to support
the king in his suit for a dispensation for the marriage of Henry and
Margaret, and that the prudent churchman declined it for the same reason.
Subsequently, with the same view, Charles sent it to his ambassador at
Rome, M. de Ferralz, instructing him to give it to the Cardinal of
Alessandria. But Ferralz, on consultation with the Cardinal of Ferrara
and others in the French interest, came to the conclusion that the gift
would be useless, and so retained it, at the same time notifying his
master. The reason may have been either that Alessandria had too little
influence, since his uncle's death, to effect what was desired, or that
the matter was of less consequence when once Charles had resolved to go
on with the marriage without waiting further for the dispensation. So I
understand Charles's words to Ferralz (Aug. 24, 1572): "J'ai aussi sceu
par vostre dicte mémoire, que par l'avis de mon cousin le cardinal de
Ferrare, <i>vous avez retenu le diamant que je vous avois envoyé pour le
donner de ma part au cardinal Alexandrin</i>, puisque mon dict cousin et mes
autres ministres trouvent que <i>le don seroit inutile et perdu</i>."

June 25, 1577) shows that it was written before the death of Charles IX.,
but the publication of which was from time to time deferred in the vain
hope that the authors of the inhuman massacre might yet repent. The new
and "more detestable perfidy, fury, and impetuosity" of which the
Huguenots were the victims in the first years of Henry III.'s reign,
finally brought it to the light. The <i>Archives curieuses</i> contain only a

The marriage of Henry of Navarre and Margaret of Valois had been delayed
in consequence of the death of the bridegroom's mother, but could now no
longer be deferred. The young queen of Charles the Ninth was soon to
become a mother, and it was desirable that she should have the
opportunity to leave the crowded and unhealthy capital as soon as
possible. Jeanne d'Albret's objection to the celebration of the wedding
in Paris had been overruled. The bride herself, indifferent enough, to
all appearance, on other points, was resolute as to this matter&mdash;she
would have her nuptials celebrated in no provincial town. Accordingly,
the King of Navarre, followed by eight hundred gentlemen of his party, as
well as by his cousin the Prince of Condé, and the admiral, made his
solemn entry into the city, which so few of his adherents were to leave
alive. Although still clad in mourning for the loss of the heroic Queen
of Navarre, they bore no unfavorable comparison with the gay courtiers,
who, with Anjou and Alençon at their head, came out to escort them into
Paris with every mark of respect.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Betrothal of Henry and Margaret.</div>

<p>The betrothal took place in the palace of the Louvre, on Sunday the
seventeenth of August. Afterward there was a supper and a ball; and when
these came to an end, Margaret was conducted by her mother, her brothers,
and a stately retinue, to the episcopal palace, on the Île de la Cité,
adjoining the cathedral, there, according to the immemorial custom of the
princesses of the blood, to pass the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> before her wedding. No papal
dispensation had arrived. Gregory XIII. was as obstinate as his
predecessor in the pontifical chair, in denying the requests of the
French envoys to Rome.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> But Charles was determined to proceed; and,
in order to silence the opposition of the Cardinal of Bourbon, who still
refused to perform the ceremony without the pope's approval, a forged
letter was shown to him, purporting to come from the Cardinal of
Lorraine, or the royal ambassador at Rome, and announcing that the bull
of dispensation had actually been sealed, and would shortly arrive.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>Preparations had been made for the wedding in a style of magnificence
extraordinary even for that age of reckless expenditure. To show their
cordial friendship and fidelity, Charles and his brothers, Anjou and
Alençon, and Henry and his cousin of Condé, assumed a costume precisely
alike&mdash;a light yellow satin, covered with silver embroidery, and enriched
with pearls and precious stones. Margaret wore a violet velvet dress with
fleurs-de-lis. Her train was adorned with the same emblems. She was
wrapped in a royal mantle, and had upon her head an imperial crown
glittering with pearls, diamonds, and other gems of incalculable value.
The queens were resplendent in cloth of gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> A lofty
platform had been erected in front of the grand old pile of Notre Dame.
Hither Margaret was brought in great pomp, from the palace of the Bishop
of Paris, escorted by the king, by Catharine de' Medici, by the Dukes of
Anjou and Alençon, and by the Guises, the marshals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> other great
personages of the realm. Upon the platform she met Henry of Navarre, with
his cousins Condé and Conty, Admiral Coligny, Count de la Rochefoucauld,
and a numerous train of Protestant lords from all parts of the kingdom.
In the sight of an immense throng, the nuptial ceremony was performed by
the Cardinal of Bourbon, Henry's uncle, according to the form which had
been previously agreed upon.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> The bridal procession then entered the
cathedral by a lower platform, which extended through the nave to the
choir. Here Henry, having placed his bride before the grand altar to hear
mass, himself retired with his Protestant companions to the episcopal
palace, and waited for the service to be over. When notified of its
conclusion by Marshal Damville, Henry and his suite returned to the
choir, and with his bride and all the attending grandees soon sat down to
a sumptuous dinner in the episcopal palace.</p>

<p>Among those who had been admitted to the choir of Notre Dame after the
close of the mass, was the son of the first president of parliament,
young Jacques Auguste de Thou, the future historian. Happening to come
near Admiral Coligny, he looked with curious and admiring gaze upon the
warrior whose virtues and abilities had combined to raise the house of
Châtillon to its present distinction. He saw him point out to his cousin
Damville the flags and banners taken from the Huguenots on the fields of
Jarnac and Moncontour, still suspended from the walls of the cathedral,
mournful trophies of a civil contest. "These will soon be torn down," De
Thou heard Coligny say, "and in their place others more pleasing to the
eye will be hung up." The words had unmistakable reference to the
victories which he hoped soon to win in a war against Spain. It is not
strange, however, that the malevolent endeavored to prove that they
contained an allusion to the renewal of a domestic war, which it is
certain that the admiral detested with his whole heart.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Entertainment in the Louvre.</div>

<p>Later in the day, a magnificent entertainment was given by Charles in the
Louvre to the municipality of Paris, the members of parliament, and other
high officers of justice. Supper was succeeded by a short ball, and this
in turn by one of those allegorical representations in which French fancy
and invention at this period ran wanton. Through the great vaulted saloon
of the Louvre a train of wonderful cars was made slowly to pass. Some
were rocks of silver, on whose summits sat in state the king's brothers,
Navarre, Condé, the prince dauphin, Guise, or Angoulême. On others
sea-monsters disported themselves, and the pagan gods of the water,
somewhat incongruously clothed in cloth of gold or various colors,
serenely looked on. Charles himself rode in a chariot shaped like a
sea-horse, the curved tail of which supported a shell holding Neptune and
his trident. When the pageant stopped for a moment, singers of surpassing
skill entertained the guests. Étienne le Roy, the king's especial
favorite, distinguished himself by the power and beauty of his
voice.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>The entertainment was prolonged far into the night; but Admiral Coligny,
before giving himself repose, snatched from sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span> a few minutes to write
a letter to his wife, whom he had left in Châtillon. It is the last which
has been preserved, and is otherwise important because of the light it
throws upon the hopes and fears of the great Huguenot at this critical
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny's letter to his wife.</div>

<p>"My darling," he said, "I write this bit of a letter to tell you that
to-day the marriage of the king's sister and the King of Navarre took
place. Three or four days will be spent in festivities, masks, and mock
combats. After that the king has assured me and given me his promise,
that he will devote a few days to attending to a number of complaints
which are made in various parts of the kingdom, touching the infraction
of the edict. It is but reasonable that I should employ myself in this
matter, so far as I am able; for, although I have infinite desire to see
you, yet should I feel great regret, and I believe that you would
likewise, were I to fail to occupy myself in such an affair with all my
ability. But this will not delay so much the departure from this city,
but that I think that the court will leave it at the beginning of next
week. If I had in view only my own satisfaction, I should take much
greater pleasure in going to see you, than in being in this court, for
many reasons which I shall tell you. But we must have more regard for the
public than for our own private interests. I have many other things to
tell you, when I am able to see you, for which I am so anxious that you
must not think that I waste a day or an hour. What remains for me to say
is that to-day, at four o'clock after noon, the bride's mass was said.
Meanwhile, the King of Navarre walked about in a court with all those of
the religion who accompanied him. Other incidents occurred which I will

Paris, this eighteenth day of August, 1572. <i>Mandez-moy comme se porte le

<div class="sidenote">Festivities and mock combats.</div>

<p>The festivities and combats&mdash;so distasteful to a statesman who recognized
the critical condition of French affairs, and regarded this merry-making
as ill-timed&mdash;pursued their uninterrupted course through Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday of that eventful week. But the description of
most of the elaborate pageants would contribute little to the value of
our conceptions of the character of the age. An exception may perhaps be
made in favor of an ingenious tournament that took place on Wednesday in
the Hôtel Bourbon. Here the Isles of the Blessed, the Elysian Fields, and
Tartarus were represented by means of costly mechanisms. Charles and his
brothers figured as knights defending Paradise, which Navarre and others,
dressed as knights-errant, endeavored to enter by force of arms, but were
repulsed and thrust into Tartarus. After some time the defeated champions
were rescued from their perilous situation by the compassion of their
victors, and the performance terminated in a startling, but harmless
display of fireworks.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> As the assailants were mostly Protestants, the
defenders Roman Catholics, it was not strange that a sinister
interpretation was soon put upon the strange plot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> but, unless we are to
suppose the authors of the massacre, whose success depended upon the
surprise of the victims, so infatuated as to wish to forewarn them of
their fate, it is scarcely credible that they intended to prefigure the
ruin of the reformed faith in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot grievances to be redressed.</div>

<p>The time that had been allotted to pleasure was fast passing. The king
was soon to meet Coligny, according to his promise, for the transaction
of important business relating both to the internal and to the foreign
affairs of France. There were religious grievances to be redressed. The
admiral was particularly anxious to bring to the king's notice the
flagrant outrage recently perpetrated in Troyes, where a fanatical Roman
Catholic populace, indignant that the Huguenots, through the kindness of
Marie de Clèves, the betrothed of the Prince of Condé,<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> had been
permitted to hold their worship so near the city as her castle of
Isle-au-Mont, scarcely three leagues distant,<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> had met the
Protestants on their return from service with aggravated insult, and had
killed in the arms of its nurse an infant that had just been baptized
according to the reformed rites.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> Catharine and her son Anjou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span> saw
with consternation that the impression made by the "tears of Montpipeau"
was already in a great degree obliterated, and feared the complete
destruction of their influence if Charles were longer permitted to have
intercourse with Coligny. In that case a Flemish war would be almost
inevitable. Charles's anger against the Spaniards had kindled anew when
he heard of Alva's inhumanity to Genlis and his fellow-prisoners. But,
when he was informed that Alva had put French soldiers to the torture, in
order to extract the admission of their monarch's complicity in the
enterprise, his passion was almost ungovernable, as he asked his
attendants again and again: "Do you know that the Duke of Alva is putting
me on trial?"<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> It seems to have been at this juncture that Catharine
and her favorite son came to the definite determination to put the great
Huguenot out of the way. Henry of Anjou is here his own accuser. In that
strange confession which he made to his physician, Miron,<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> shortly
after his arrival in Cracow&mdash;a confession made under the influence, not
so much of remorse, as of the annoyance occasioned by the continual
reminders of the massacre which were thrown in his way as he travelled to
assume the throne of Poland&mdash;he gives us a partial view of the
development of the murderous plot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jealousy of Catharine and Anjou.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Duchess of Nemours and Henry of Guise.</div>

<p>Several times had Anjou and Catharine perceived that, whenever Charles
had conversed in private with the admiral, his demeanor was visibly
changed toward them. He no longer exhibited his accustomed respect for
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> mother or his wonted kindness for his brother. Once, in
particular&mdash;and it was, so Anjou tells us, only a few days before St.
Bartholomew's Day&mdash;Henry happened to enter the room just after Coligny
had gone out. Instantly the king's countenance betrayed extreme anger. He
began to walk furiously to and fro, taking great strides, and keeping his
eyes fixed upon his brother with an expression that boded no good, but
without uttering a word. Again and again he placed his hand on his
dagger, and Anjou expected nothing less than that his brother would
attack him. At last, taking advantage of an opportunity when Charles's
back was turned, he hastily retreated from the room. This circumstance
led Catharine and Anjou to compare their observations and their plans.
"Both of us," says Henry, "were easily persuaded, and became, as it were,
certain that it was the admiral who had impressed some evil and sinister
opinion of us upon the king. We resolved from that moment to rid
ourselves of him, and to concert the means of doing so with the Duchess
of Nemours. To her alone we believed that we might safely disclose our
purpose, on account of the mortal hatred which we knew that she bore to
him."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> The Duchess of Nemours was born of an excellent mother; for
she was Anne d'Este, daughter of Renée of France, the younger child of
Louis the Twelfth. In her youth, at the court of her father, the Duke of
Ferrara, and in society with that prodigy of feminine precocity, Olympia
Morata, she had shown evidences of extraordinary intellectual development
and of a kindly disposition.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Although she subsequently married
Francis of Guise, the leading persecutor of the Protestants, she had not
so lost her sympathy with the oppressed as to witness without tears and
remonstrances the atrocious executions by which the tumult of Amboise was
followed. But the assassination of her husband turned any affection or
compassion she may have entertained for Protestantism into violent
hatred. Against Coligny, whom, in spite of his protestations, she
persisted in believing to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> instigator of Poltrot's crime, she bore
an implacable enmity; and now, having so often failed in obtaining
satisfaction from the king by judicial process, she eagerly accepted the
opportunity of avenging herself by a deed more dastardly than that which
she laid to the charge of her enemy. Entering heartily into the project
which Catharine and Anjou laid before her, the Duchess of Nemours
enlisted the co-operation of her son, Henry of Guise, and her
brother-in-law, the Duke of Aumale, and herself arranged the details of
the plan, which was at once to be put into execution.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Was the massacre long premeditated?</div>

<div class="sidenote">Salviati's testimony.</div>

<p>Such was the germ of the massacre as yet not resolved upon, which,
rapidly developing, was to involve the murder of thousands of innocent
persons throughout France. In opposition to the opinion that became
almost universal among the Protestants, and gained nearly equal currency
among the Roman Catholics&mdash;that the butchery had long been contemplated,
and that Charles was privy to it&mdash;and notwithstanding the circumstances
that seem to give color to this opinion,<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> I am compelled to acquiesce
in the belief expressed by the Papal Nuncio, Salviati, who, in his
despatches, written in cipher to the cardinal secretary of state, could
certainly have had no motive to disguise his real sentiments, and whom it
is impossible to suppose ignorant of any scheme for the general
extirpation of the Protestants, had such a scheme existed for any
considerable length of time: "As to all the statements that will be made
respecting the firing upon the admiral and his death, different from that
which I have written to you, you will in time find out how true they are.
Madame the regent, having come to be at variance with him [the admiral],
and having decided upon this step a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> days before, caused him to be
fired upon. This was <i>without the knowledge of the king</i>, but with the
participation of the Duke of Anjou, the Duchess of Nemours, and her son,
the Duke of Guise. If the admiral had died at once, no others would have
been slain. But, inasmuch as he survived, and they apprehended that some
great calamity might happen should he draw closer to the king, they
resolved to throw aside shame, and to have him killed together with the
rest. And this was put into execution that very night."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's cordiality.</div>

<p>As the hour approached, Coligny exhibited no apprehension of special
danger. Others, however, more suspicious, or possessed of less faith in
Heaven, felt alarm; and some acted upon their fears. The very "goodness"
of the king terrified one. Another said that he had rather be saved with
fools than perish with the wise, and hastily forsook the capital. Dark
hints had been thrown out by courtiers&mdash;such surmises were naturally bred
by the defenceless position of the Protestants in the midst of a
population so hostile to their faith as the population of Paris&mdash;that
more blood than wine would be spilled at this wedding. And there were
rumors of some mysterious enterprise afloat; so, at least, it was said
after the occurrence. But Coligny moved not from the post which he
believed had been assigned to his keeping. On Wednesday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span> Charles assured
him, with laughing countenance, that if the admiral would but give him
four days more for amusement, he would not stir from Paris until he had
contented him;<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> and the sturdy old Huguenot made no objection when
the king, in order to prevent any disturbance which the partisans of
Guise might occasion in seeking a quarrel with the followers of the house
of Châtillon, proposed to introduce a considerable force of soldiers into
the city. "My father," said Charles, with his usual appearance of
affection, "you know that you have promised not to give any cause of
offence to the Guises so long as you remain here; and they have in like
manner promised to respect you and all yours. I am fully persuaded that
you will keep your word; but I am not so well assured of their good faith
as of yours; for, besides the fact that it is they that would avenge
themselves, I know their bravadoes and the favor this populace bears to
them."<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny is wounded, August 22.</div>

<p>On Friday morning, the twenty-second of August, Admiral Coligny went to
the Louvre, to attend a meeting of the royal council, at which Henry of
Anjou presided. It was between ten and eleven o'clock, when, according to
the more primitive hours then kept, he left the palace to return home for
dinner.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> Meeting Charles just coming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> of a chapel in front of the
Louvre, he retraced his steps, and accompanied him to the tennis-court,
where he left him playing with Guise, against Téligny and another
nobleman. Accompanied by about a dozen gentlemen, he again sallied forth,
but had not proceeded over a hundred paces when from behind a lattice an
arquebuse was fired at him.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> The admiral had been walking slowly,
intently engaged in reading a petition which had just been handed to him.
The shot had been well aimed, and might have proved fatal, had not the
victim at that very moment turned a little to one side. As it was, of the
three balls with which the arquebuse was loaded, one took off a finger of
his right hand, and another lodged in his left arm, making an ugly wound.
Supported by De Guerchy and Des Pruneaux, between whom he had previously
been walking, Coligny was carried to his house in the little Rue de
Béthisy,<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> only a few steps farther on. As he went he pointed out to
his friends the house from which the shot had been fired. To a gentleman
who expressed the fear that the balls were poisoned, he replied with
composure: "Nothing will happen but what it may please God to
order."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>The attempted assassination had happened in front of the cloisters of St.
Germain l'Auxerrois. The house was recognized as one belonging to the
Duchess Dowager of Guise, in which Villemur, the former tutor of young
Henry of Guise, had lodged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> The door was found locked; but the indignant
followers of Coligny soon burst it open. They found within only a woman
and a lackey. The assassin, after firing, had fled to the rear of the
house. There he found a horse awaiting him; this he exchanged at the
Porte Saint Antoine for a fresh Spanish jennet. He was out of Paris
almost before pursuit was fairly undertaken. Subsequent investigation
left no doubt as to his identity. It was that same Maurevel of infamous
memory, who during the third civil war had traitorously shot De Mouy,
after insinuating himself into his friendship, and sharing his room and
his bed. The king's assassin, "le tueur du roi"&mdash;a designation he had
obtained when Charles or his advisers gave a special reward for that
exploit<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a>&mdash;had been selected by Catharine, Anjou and the Guises, as
possessing both the nerve and the experience that were requisite to make
sure of Coligny's death. It was found that he had been placed in the
house by De Chailly, "maître d'hôtel" of the king, and that the horse by
means of which he effected his escape had been brought to the door by the
groom of the Duke of Guise.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Agitation of the king.</div>

<p>Charles was still in the tennis-court, when De Piles came in, sent by
Coligny, to inform him of the bloody infraction of the Edict of
Pacification. On hearing the intelligence, the king was violently
agitated. Throwing down his racket, he exclaimed: "Am I, then, never to
have peace? What! always new troubles?" and retired to his room in the
Louvre, with a countenance expressive of great dejection.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> And when,
later in the day, the King of Navarre, the Prince of Condé, and La
Rochefoucauld, after seeing Coligny's wounds dressed, came to the palace
and begged him for permission to leave a city in which there was no
security for their lives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> Charles swore to them, with his accustomed
profanity, that he would inflict upon the author and abettors of the
crime so signal a punishment that Coligny and his friends would be
satisfied, and posterity have a warning example. Coligny had received the
wound, he said, but the smart was <i>his</i>. Catharine, who was present,
chimed in, and declared the outrage so flagrant, that just retribution
must speedily be meted out, or insolence would be pushed so far as that
the king would be attacked in his own palace.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny courageous.</div>

<p>Meantime the admiral bore his sufferings with serenity, and, far from
needing any comfort his friends could give him, himself administered
consolation to the noblemen around his bed. His sufferings were acute.
Amboise Paré, the famous surgeon of the king, himself a Huguenot, was
called in; but the instruments at hand were dull, and it was not until
the third attempt that he could satisfactorily amputate the wounded
finger. "My friends," said Coligny to Merlin, his minister, and to other
friends, "why do you weep? As for me, I think myself happy in having
received these wounds for the name of God." And when Merlin exhorted him
"to thank God for His mercy in preserving his mental faculties sound and
entire, and to continue to divert his thoughts and feelings from his
assassin and his wounds, and to turn them, as he was doing, from all
things else to God, since it was from His hands that he had received
them," the admiral's reply was, that sincerely and from the heart he
forgave the person who had wounded him, and those who had instigated him,
holding it for certain that it was beyond their power to injure him,
since, should they even kill him, death would be an assured passage to
life.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> Thus, with quiet submission, and with edifying prayers which
it would be too long to insert, the Admiral de Coligny passed those hours
which his enemies subsequently, in their desperate attempts to justify or
palliate the most abominable of crimes, represented as given up to
infamous plots against king and state. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">He is visited by the king and his mother.</div>

<p>That afternoon, between two and three o'clock, Charles visited the
wounded man, at the suggestion of Téligny and Damville; for Coligny had
expressed a desire to see the monarch, that he might communicate certain
matters which concerned him greatly, but of which he feared there was no
one else that would inform him.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> The king came, accompanied by his
mother, his brothers, the Duke of Montpensier, Cardinal Bourbon, Marshals
Damville, Tavannes and Cossé, Count de Retz, and the younger
Montmorencies, Thoré and Méru.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> The interview was kind and
reassuring. The admiral, who lay upon his bed, heartily thanked the king
for the honor he had deigned to do him, and for the measures he had
already taken in his behalf. And Charles praised the patience and
magnanimity exhibited by Coligny, and bade him be of good courage. Then
more important topics were introduced. There were three points respecting
which the admiral wished to speak to Charles. The first was his own
loyalty, which, however much it had been maligned by his enemies, he
desired now solemnly to reaffirm, in the presence of Him before whose bar
he might soon be called to stand, and he declared that the sole cause of
the hostility he had aroused was his attempt to set bounds to the fury of
those who presumed to violate royal edicts. Next, he commended to the
king the Flemish project. Never had any predecessor of Charles enjoyed so
splendid an opportunity as now offered, when several cities of the
Netherlands had declared their desire for his favor and protection. But
these advances were openly derided by some of the courtiers about the
king; while state secrets were so badly kept, that "one could not turn an
egg, nor utter a word in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span> council, but it was forthwith reported to
the Duke of Alva." And, indeed, what else could be expected, since those
who were present, and even his own brothers, communicated to foreigners
and enemies the king's most confidential deliberations? He earnestly
begged Charles to apply a prompt remedy to this matter in future. The
last point was the observance of the Edict of Pacification. What opinion
would foreign nations form of the king, if he suffered a law solemnly
made, and frequently confirmed by oath, to be openly trampled upon? In
proof of this assertion, he alleged the recent attack upon the
Protestants of Troyes returning from their place of worship, the tragic
termination of which has already been noticed.</p>

<p>To that part of Coligny's remarks which related to the war in Flanders,
it is said that Charles made no direct reply; but he declared that he had
never suspected the admiral's loyalty, and that he accounted him a good
man, and a great and generous captain. There was not another man in the
kingdom whom he would prefer to him. And he again asseverated his
intention to enforce a religious observance of his edicts; for which
purpose, indeed, he had recently despatched commissioners into all the
provinces, as the queen could inform him. "That is true, Monsieur
l'amiral," said Catharine, "and you know it." "Yes, madam," he replied,
"commissioners have been sent, among whom are some that condemned me to
be hung, and set a price of fifty thousand crowns on my head." "Then,"
rejoined Charles, "we must send others who are open to no suspicion."
Again he promised with his accustomed oath to see that the attempt upon
the admiral's life should be so punished that the retribution would be
forever remembered;<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> after which he inquired whether Coligny were
satisfied with the judges whom he had appointed to conduct the
investigation. Coligny replied that he committed himself in this matter
to the king's prudence, but suggested that Cavaignes, the recently
appointed maître de requêtes, and two other Huguenots be added to the
commission. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>The king and De Retz both endeavored to persuade the admiral to permit
himself to be transported, for safety's sake, to the Louvre; but
Coligny's friends would not consent to a removal which might endanger his
life. Charles requested, before he left, to see the ball extracted from
the wounded arm, and examined it with apparent curiosity. Catharine took
it next, and said that she was glad that it had been removed, for she
remembered that, when the Duke of Guise was shot, the physicians
repeatedly said that, even if the ball were poisoned, there was no danger
to be apprehended when once the ball was taken out. Many afterward
regarded it as a significant circumstance that the queen mother's mind
should have reverted on this occasion to the murder of which the Lorraine
family still persisted in accusing Coligny of having been the
instigator.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine attempts to break up the conference.</div>

<p>Such was, according to the solitary Huguenot who was present by Coligny's
bed, and who survived the subsequent massacre, the substance of the
conversation at this celebrated interview. But, if we may credit the
account which purports to have been given by Henry of Anjou, there was an
incident which he failed to mention. At a certain point in the
conversation Coligny asked to be allowed to speak to the king in private,
a request which Charles willingly granted, motioning Henry and Catharine
to withdraw. They accordingly retired to the middle of the room, where
they remained standing during the suspicious colloquy. Meanwhile their
apprehensions were awakened as they noticed that there were more than two
hundred gentlemen and captains of the admiral's party in this and an
adjacent room and below stairs. The sad looks of the Huguenots, their
gestures expressive of discontent, their suppressed whispers, as they
passed to and fro, before and behind the queen and her favorite son, with
less respect than the latter thought was due to them, impressed them with
the idea that they were objects of distrust. Catharine afterward admitted
to Henry that never in her life was she so glad to get out of any other
place. Her impatience soon impelled her to cut short the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>ference
between Charles and Coligny&mdash;much to the regret of Charles&mdash;on the
pretext that longer conversation might retard the sick man's recovery.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the royal party left the admiral's lodgings, when Catharine
began to ply Charles with questions respecting Coligny's private
communication. Several times he absolutely refused to satisfy her
curiosity. But at last, losing all patience, he roughly answered her with
an oath: "What the admiral told me was true: kings are recognized as such
in France only so far as they have the power to reward or punish their
subjects and servants; and this power and the management of the affairs
of the entire state have insensibly slipped into your hands. But this
authority of yours, the admiral told me, may some day become highly
prejudicial both to me and to my whole kingdom, and I ought to look upon
it with suspicion, and to be on my guard. Of this he had desired, as one
of my best and most faithful subjects, to warn me before he died. Well
then, <i>mon Dieu</i>, since you will know it, this is what the admiral was
telling me." "This was uttered," Anjou subsequently said, "with so much
passion and fury, that the speech cut us to the heart. We concealed our
emotion as best we could, and vindicated ourselves. This discourse we
pursued from the admiral's lodgings to the Louvre. There, after having
left the king in his own room, we retired to that of the queen, my
mother, who was nettled and offended in the highest degree by this
language of the admiral to the king, and still more by the credit the
king seemed to give it, fearing that this might occasion some change in
our affairs and in the conduct of the state. To be frank, we found
ourselves so unprovided with counsel and understanding, that, being
unable to come to any determination at that time, we separated, deferring
the matter until the morrow."<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles writes letters expressing his displeasure.</div>

<p>Meantime, Charles, not content with closing all the gates of Paris, save
two, which were to be strictly guarded, and with ordering a speedy
judicial investigation, despatched, on the very day of the attempt on
Coligny's life, a circular letter to all the governors of the provinces,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> a similar letter to his ambassadors at foreign courts, declarative
of his profound displeasure at this audacious crime. In the former he
said: "I am at once sending in every direction in pursuit of the
perpetrator, with a view to catch him and inflict such punishment upon
him as is required by a deed so wicked, so displeasing, and, moreover, so
inconvenient; for the reparation of which I wish to forget nothing." And
lest any persons, whether Protestants or Roman Catholics, should be
aroused by this news to make a disturbance of the peace, he called upon
all the governors to explain the full circumstances of the case. "Assure
every one," he wrote, "that it is my intention to observe inviolate my
edict of pacification, and so strictly to punish those who contravene its
provisions, that men may judge how sincere is my will."<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> In a similar
strain he wrote to his ambassador in England, that he was "infinitely
sorry" (infiniment marry), and that he desired him to acquaint Queen
Elizabeth with his determination to cause such signal justice to be
executed, that every one in his realm might take example therefrom.
"Monsieur de la Mothe Fénélon," he added in a postscript, "I must not
forget to tell you that this wicked act proceeds from the enmity between
his [the admiral's] house and the Guises. I shall know how to provide
that they involve none of my subjects in their quarrels; for I intend
that my edict of pacification be observed in all points."<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vidame de Chartres advises the Huguenots to leave Paris.</div>

<p>Not long after the king had left Coligny's room, the admiral Was visited
by Jean de Ferrières, Vidame de Chartres, a leading Huguenot, who came to
condole with him. He also had a more practical object in view. In a
conference of the great nobles of the reformed faith, held in the room
adjoining the admiral's, he advocated the instant departure of the
Protestants from Paris, and urged it at considerable length. He saw in
the event of the day the first act of a tragedy whose catastrophe could
not be long deferred. The Huguenots had thrust their head into the very
jaws of the lion; it were prudent to draw it out while it was yet time.
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> this sensible advice, based less upon any distinct evidence of a
plot for their destruction than upon the obvious temptation which their
defenceless situation offered to a woman proverbially unscrupulous, was
overruled by the majority of those present. Téligny, in particular, the
accomplished and amiable son-in-law of Coligny, opposed a scheme which
not only might endanger the admiral's life, but would certainly displease
the king, by betraying distrust of his ability or his inclination to
defend his Protestant subjects.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a></p>

<p>Saturday morning came, and with it a report from Coligny's physicians,
announcing that his wounds would not prove serious. Meanwhile the
investigation into the attempted assassination was pursued, and disclosed
more and more evidence of the complicity of the Guises. The young duke
and his uncle Aumale, conscious of the suspicion in which they were held,
and fearful perhaps of the king's anger, should the part they had taken
become known, prepared to retire from Paris, and came to Charles to ask
for leave of absence, telling him at the same time that they had long
noticed that their services were not pleasing to him. Charles, with
little show of courtesy, bade them depart. Should they prove guilty, he
said, he would find means to bring them to justice.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine and Anjou come to a final decision.</div>

<p>And now the time had arrived when Catharine and the Duke of Anjou must
come to a final decision respecting the means of extricating themselves
from their present embarrassments. Maurevel's shot had done no execution.
Coligny was likely to recover, to be more than ever the idol of the
Huguenots, to become more than ever the favorite of the king. In that
case the influence of Catharine and her younger son would be
irretrievably lost; especially if the judicial investigation now in
progress should reveal the fact that they were the prime movers in the
plan of assassination. Certainly neither Henry of Guise nor his mother
would consent to bear the entire responsibility. More than that, the
Huguenots were uttering loud demands for justice, which to guilty
consciences sounded like threats of retribution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>We must here recur to Henry of Anjou's own account of this critical
period; for that strange confession throws the only gleam of light upon
the process by which the young king was moved to the adoption of a course
whereby he earned the reputation&mdash;of which it will be difficult to divest
him&mdash;of a monster of cruelty. "I went," says Anjou, "to see my mother,
who had already risen. I was filled with anxiety, as also she was on her
side. We adopted at that time no other determination than to despatch the
admiral by whatever means possible. As artifice and cunning could no
longer be employed, we must proceed by open measures. But, to do this, we
must bring the king to this same resolution. We decided that we would go
in the afternoon to his private room, and would bring in the Duke of
Nevers, Marshals Tavannes and Retz, and Chancellor Birague, solely to
obtain their advice as to the means we should employ in executing the
plan upon which my mother and I had already agreed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They ply Charles with arguments.</div>

<p>"As soon as we had entered the room in which the king my brother was, my
mother began to represent to him that the party of the Huguenots was
arming against him on account of the wounding of the admiral, the latter
having sent several despatches to Germany to make a levy of ten thousand
horse, and to the cantons of Switzerland for another levy of ten thousand
foot; that most of the French captains belonging to the Huguenot party
had already left in order to raise troops within the kingdom; and that
the time and place of assembling had been fixed upon. Let so powerful an
army as this once be joined to their French troops&mdash;a thing which was
only too practicable&mdash;and the king's forces would not be half sufficient
to resist them, in view of the intrigues and leagues they had, inside and
outside of the kingdom, with many cities, communities, and nations. Of
this she had good and certain advices. Their allies were to revolt in
conjunction with the Huguenots under pretext of the public good; and for
him (Charles), being weak in pecuniary resources, she saw no place of
security in France. And, indeed, there was besides a new consequence of
which she wished to warn him. It was that all the Catholics, wearied by
so long a war, and vexed by so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> sorts of calamities, were determined
to put an end to them. In case he refused to follow their counsel, they
also had determined among themselves to elect a captain-general to
undertake their protection, and to form a league offensive and defensive
against the Huguenots. Thus he would remain alone, enveloped in great
danger, and without power or authority. All France would be seen armed by
two great parties, over which he would have no command, and from which he
could exact just as little obedience. But, to ward off so great a danger,
a peril impending over him and his entire state, so much ruin, and so
many calamities which were in preparation and just at hand, and the
murder of so many thousands of men&mdash;to avert all these misfortunes, a
single thrust of the sword would suffice&mdash;the admiral, the head and
author of all the civil wars, alone need be put to death. The designs and
enterprises of the Huguenots would perish with him; and the Catholics,
satisfied with the sacrifice of two or three men, would remain obedient
to him (the king)."</p>

<p>Such arguments, and many more of a similar character, does Henry tell us
that he and his wily mother addressed to the unhappy Charles. At first
their words irritated him, and, without convincing, drove him into a
frenzy of excitement. A little later, giving credit to the oft-repeated
assertions of his false advisers, and his imagination becoming inflamed
by the picture of the dangers surrounding him which they so skilfully
painted, he would, nevertheless, hear nothing of the crime to which he
was urged, but began anxiously to consult those who were present whether
there were no other means of escape. Each man gave his opinion in
succession; and each supported Catharine's views, until it came to the
turn of Retz, who, contrary to the expectation of the conspirators, gave
expression to more noble sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> If any one were justified in
hating Coligny and his faction, he said, it was himself, maligned, as he
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> been, both in France and abroad; but he was unwilling, in avenging
private wrongs, to involve France and its royal family in dishonor. The
king would justly be taxed with perfidy, and all confidence in his word
or in public faith would be lost. Henceforth it would be impossible to
treat for terms of peace in those new civil wars in which the French must
be involved, and of which their children would not see the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king consents reluctantly.</div>

<p>These wholesome words at first struck speechless the advocates of murder.
Then they undertook, by repeating their arguments, to destroy the effect
of the prophetic warning to which the king had just listened. They
succeeded but too well. "That instant," says Henry of Anjou, "we
perceived a sudden change, a strange and wonderful metamorphosis in the
king. He placed himself on our side, and adopted our opinion, going much
beyond us and to more criminal lengths; since, whereas before it was
difficult to persuade him, now we had to restrain him. For, rising and
addressing us, while imposing silence upon us, he told us in anger and
fury, swearing by God's death that, 'since we thought it good that the
admiral should be killed, he would have it so; but that with him all the
Huguenots of France must be killed, in order that not one might remain to
reproach him hereafter; and that we should promptly see to it.' And going
out furiously, he left us in his room, where we deliberated the rest of
the day, during the evening, and for a good part of the night, and
decided upon that which seemed advisable for the execution of such an
enterprise."<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<p>This is the strange record of the change by which Charles, from being the
friend of Admiral Coligny, became the accomplice in his murder and in
countless other assassinations throughout France. The admission of his
guilt by one of the principal actors in the tragedy is so frank and
undisguised that we find it difficult to believe that the narrative can
have emanated from his lips. But the freaks of a burdened conscience are
not to be easily accounted for. The most callous or reticent criminal
sometimes is aroused to a recognition of his wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>ness, and burns to
communicate to another the fearful secret whose deposit has become
intolerable to himself. And fortunately the confession of the princely
felon does not stand alone. The son of another of the wretches who
persuaded Charles to imbrue his hands in the blood of his subjects has
given us the account which he undoubtedly received from his father
shortly before his death, and we find the two statements to be in
substantial agreement. Tavannes says: "The king notified (of the attempt
upon Coligny's life), is offended, and threatens the Guises, not knowing
whence the blow came. After a while, he is appeased by the queen,
assisted by the sieur de Retz. They make his Majesty angry with the
Huguenots&mdash;a vice peculiar to his Majesty, who is of choleric humor. They
induce him to believe that they have discovered an enterprise of the
Huguenots directed against him. He is reminded of the designs of Meaux
and of Amboise. Suddenly gained over, as his mother had promised herself
that he would be, he abandons the Huguenots, and remains sorry, with the
rest, that the wound had not proved mortal."<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Few victims selected at first.</div>

<p>And now, the assassination of the admiral having received the king's
approval, it only remained to decide upon the number of Protestants who
should be involved with him in a common destruction, and to perfect the
arrangements for the execution of the murderous plot. How many, and who
were the victims whose sacrifice was predetermined? This is a question
which, with our present means of information, we are unable to answer.
Catharine, it is true, used to declare in later times that she
contemplated no general massacre; that she took upon her conscience the
blood of only five or six persons;<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and, although the unsupported
assertion of so perfidious a woman is certainly not entitled to any great
consideration, we can readily see that the heads of half a dozen leaders
might have fully contented her. She was not seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> for revenge so much
as paving the way for her ambition. There were few Huguenots who were
apparently so powerful as to interfere with her projects. Coligny, their
acknowledged head; the Count of Montgomery, personally hated as the
occasion of the death of her husband, Henry the Second, in the ill-fated
tournament; the Vidame of Chartres; and La Rochefoucauld&mdash;these were
doubtless of the number. Would she have desired to include the King of
Navarre and the Prince of Condé? Not the former, on account of his recent
marriage with her daughter. Yet to whom the Bourbons were indebted for
the omission of their names from the proscriptive roll we cannot tell.
After the accession of Henry the Fourth, it became the interest of all
the families concerned to put the conduct of their ancestors in the most
favorable light. Thus, Jean de Tavannes states that his father saved the
life of the Bearnese in that infamous conclave; but so little did the
latter believe him, that, on the contrary, he persistently refused to
confer upon him the marshal's baton, which he would otherwise have
received, on the ground that Gaspard de Tavannes was an instigator of the
massacre.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious hatred.</div>

<p>Thus much must be held to be clearly established: that fancied political
exigencies demanded the assassination of only very few persons; that
personal hatred, on the part of the principal or of the minor
conspirators, added many more; that a still greater number were murdered
in cold blood, simply that their spoils might enrich the assassins. What
part must be assigned to religious zeal?<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> To any true outgrowth of
religion, none at all; but much to the malice and the depraved moral
teachings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span> of its professed representatives. The hatred of Protestantism,
engendered in the minds of the people by long years devoted to traducing
the character and designs of the reformers, now bore fruit after its own
kind, in revolting crimes of every sort; while the lesson, sedulously
inculcated by priests, bishops, and monks, that obstinate heretics might
righteously be, and ought to be exterminated from the face of the earth,
permitted many a Parisian burgess to commit acts from which any but the
most diabolic nature would otherwise have recoiled in horror. But of the
measure of the responsibility of the Roman pontiff and his clergy for
this stupendous crime, it will be necessary to speak in the sequel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Precautionary measures.</div>

<p>In devising the plan for the destruction of the Huguenots, the queen
mother and her council were greatly assisted by the course pursued by the
Huguenots themselves, and by the very circumstances of the case. Under
pretence of taking measures to secure the safety of the Protestants, the
"quarteniers" could go, without exciting suspicion, from house to house,
and make a complete list of all belonging to the reformed church.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>
The same excuse served to justify the court in posting a body of twelve
hundred arquebusiers, a part along the river, a part in the immediate
neighborhood of Coligny's residence.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> And now the Protestants
themselves, startled by the unusual commotion which they noticed in the
city, and by the frequent passage to and fro of men carrying arms, sent a
gentleman to the Louvre to ask the king for a few guards to protect the
dwelling of their wounded leader. The request was only for five or six
guards; but Charles, feigning astonishment and deep regret that there
should be any reason for such apprehensions, insisted, at the suggestion
of his brother Anjou, who stood by, upon despatching fifty, under command
of Cosseins. So well known was the captain's hostility to Coligny and the
Protestants, that Thoré, Montmorency's brother, whispered to the Huguenot
messenger as he withdrew: "You could not have been given in guard to a
worse enemy;" but the royal direction was so positive that no
remonstrance seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span> possible. Accordingly, Cosseins and his arquebusiers
took possession, in the king's name, of two shops adjoining Coligny's
abode.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> With as little ceremony, Rambouillet, the "maréchal des
logis," turned the Roman Catholic gentlemen out of the lodgings he had
previously assigned them in the Rue de Béthisy, and gave the quarters to
the Protestant gentlemen instead.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> The reason assigned for this
action was that the Huguenots might be nearer to each other and to the
admiral, for mutual protection; the real object seems to have been to
sweep them more easily into the common net of destruction.</p>

<p>And yet the majority of the Huguenot leaders were not alive to the
dangers of their situation. In a second conference held late on Saturday,
the Vidame of Chartres was almost alone in urging instant retreat.
Navarre, Condé, and others thought it sufficient to demand justice, and
the departure of the Guises, as possessing dangerous credit with the
common people. Téligny again dwelt upon the wrong done to Charles in
distrusting his sincerity, and deprecated a course that might naturally
irritate him. One Bouchavannes was noticed in the conference&mdash;a professed
Protestant, but suspiciously intimate with Catharine, Retz, and other
avowed enemies of the faith. He said nothing, but listened attentively.
So soon as the meeting was over, Bouchavannes went to the Louvre and
related the discussion to the queen mother.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> The traitor's report,
doubtless grossly exaggerated, is supposed to have decided Catharine to
prompt action. It is certain, at least, that the calumnious perversion of
the speeches and resolutions of the Huguenot conference was employed to
inflame the passions of the mob, as well as to justify the atrocities of
the morrow in the eyes of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Orders issued to the prévôt des marchands.</div>

<p>It was now late in the evening of Saturday, the twenty-third of August.
Coligny had been writing to his friends throughout France, recommending
them to be quiet, and informing them of the investigations now in
progress. God and the king, he said, would do justice. His wounds were
not mortal, thank God. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> his <i>arm</i> was wounded, his <i>brain</i> was yet
sound.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> Meantime, the original framers of the murderous plot had
called in the Guises, who in reality had not left Paris.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> It had been
arranged that the execution should be intrusted to them, in conjunction
with the Bastard of Angoulême, Charles's natural brother, and Marshal
Tavannes. And now at last we emerge from the mist that envelops many of
the preliminaries of the night of horrors. The records of the Hôtel de
Ville contain the first documentary evidence of the coming massacre.
There is no longer any doubt, unfortunately, of Charles's approval and
complicity. "This day, the twenty-third day of August, very late in the
evening," Charles sends for Charron, "prévôt des marchands," to come to
the Louvre. Here, in the presence of the queen mother, the Duke of Anjou
and other princes and lords, his Majesty "declares that he has received
intelligence that those of the new religion intend to make a rising by
conspiracy against himself and his state, and to disturb the peace of his
subjects and of his city of Paris; and that this very night some great
personages of the said new religion and rebels have conspired against him
and his said state, going to such lengths as to send his Majesty some
arrogant messages which sounded like menaces." Consequently, in order to
protect himself and the royal family, Charles directs the prévôt to seize
the keys of all the gates of the city, and to keep them carefully closed,
in order to prevent any one from entering or leaving Paris. He also
commands him to remove all the boats moored along the Seine, so as to
prevent any one from crossing the river; and to put under arms all
captains, lieutenants, ensigns, and burgesses capable of doing military
duty.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> The orders were faithfully and promptly obeyed. Long before
morning dawned they had been transmitted successively to the lower
municipal officers, quarteniers, dizainiers, etc.; the wherry-men had
been stopped, and the troops and burgesses of Paris having armed
themselves as best they could, were assembled ready for action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> in front
of the Hôtel de Ville, on that famous Place de Grève, so often drenched
in martyr's blood.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The first shot and the bell of St. Germain l'Auxerrois.</div>

<p>To the guilty plotters that was a sleepless night. Unable to rest
quietly, at a little before dawn, Catharine with her two elder sons found
her way to the portal of the Louvre, adjoining the tennis court. There,
in a chamber overlooking the "bassecour," they sat down to await the
beginning of their treacherous enterprise. If we may believe Henry of
Anjou, none of them as yet realized its full horrors; but as they quietly
watched in that hour of stillness for the first signs of the coming
outbreak, the report of a pistol-shot reached their ears. Instantly it
wrought a marvellous revulsion in their feelings. Whether the shot
wounded or killed any one, they knew not; but it brought up vividly to
their imaginations the results of the terrible deluge of blood whose
flood-gates they had raised. Hastily they send a servant to the Duke of
Guise, and countermand the instructions of the evening, and bid him do no
injury to the admiral. It is too late! The messenger soon returns with
the tidings that Coligny is already dead, that the work is about to begin
in all the rest of the city. This news produces a fresh change. With one
of those fluctuations which are so easy for souls that have no firm or
established principles, but shift according to the deceptive,
ever-varying tide of apparent interest, the mother and her sons return
heartily to their former purpose. The die is cast, the deed is half done;
let it be fully and boldly consummated. No room now for pity or
regret.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

<p>It was a Sunday morning, the twenty-fourth of August&mdash;a day sacred in the
Roman calendar to the memory of Saint Bartholomew. Torches and blazing
lights had been burning all night in the streets, to render the task
easy. The houses in which Protestants lodged had been distinctly marked
with a white cross. The assassins themselves had agreed upon badges for
mutual recognition&mdash;a white cross on the hat, and a handkerchief tied
about the right arm. The signal for beginning was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> given by the
great bell of the "Palais de Justice" on the island of the old
"cité."<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p>The preparations had not been so cautiously made but that they attracted
the notice of some of the Huguenots living near Coligny. Going out to
inquire the meaning of the clash of arms, and the unusual light in the
streets, they received the answer that there was to be a mock combat in
the Louvre&mdash;a pleasure castle was to be assaulted for the king's
diversion.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> But, as they went farther and approached the Louvre,
their eyes were greeted by the sight of more torches and a great number
of armed men. The guards, full of the contemplated plot, could not
refrain from insults. It soon came to blows, and a Gascon soldier wounded
a Protestant gentleman with his halberd. It may have been at this time
that the shot was fired which Catharine and her sons heard from the open
window of the Louvre. Declaring that the fury of the troops could no
longer be restrained, the queen now gave orders to ring the bell of the
neighboring church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of Admiral Coligny.</div>

<p>Meantime Henry of Guise, Henry of Valois, the Bastard of Angoulême, and
their attendants, had reached the admiral's house. The wounded man was
almost alone. Could there be any clearer proof of the rectitude of his
purpose, of the utter falsity of the charges of conspiracy with which his
enemies afterward attempted to blacken his memory?<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> Guerchy and other
Protestant gentlemen had expressed the desire to spend the night with
him; but his son-in-law, Téligny, full of confidence in Charles's good
intentions, had declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span> their offers, and had, indeed, himself gone to
his own lodgings, not far off, in the Rue St. Honoré.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> With Coligny
were Merlin, his chaplain, Paré, the king's surgeon, his ensign Cornaton,
La Bonne, Yolet, and four or five servants. In the court below there were
five of Navarre's Swiss guards on duty.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> Coligny, awakened by the
growing noise in the streets, had at first felt no alarm, so implicitly
did he rely upon the protestations of Charles, so confident was he that
Cosseins and his guards would readily quell any rising of the
Parisians.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> But now some one knocks at the outer door, and demands an
entrance in the king's name. Word is given to La Bonne, who at once
descends and unlocks. It is Cosseins, followed by the soldiers whom he
commands. No sooner does he pass the threshold than he stabs La Bonne
with his dagger. Next he seeks the admiral's room, but it is not easy to
reach it, for the brave Swiss, even at the risk of their own lives,
defend first the door leading to the stairs, and then the stairs
themselves. And now Coligny could no longer doubt the meaning of the
uproar. He rose from his bed, and, wrapping his dressing-gown about him,
asked his chaplain to pray; and while Merlin endeavored to fulfil his
request, he himself in audible petitions invoked Jesus Christ as his God
and Saviour, and committed to His hands again the soul he had received
from Him. It was then that the person to Whom we are indebted for this
account&mdash;and he can scarcely have been another than Cornaton&mdash;rushed into
the room. When Paré asked him what the disturbance imported, he turned to
the admiral and said: "My lord, it is God that is calling us to Himself!
The house has been forced, and we have no means of resistance!" To whom
the admiral, unmoved by fear, and even, as all who saw him testified,
without the least change of countenance, replied: "For a long time have I
kept myself in readiness for death. As for you, save yourselves, if you
can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span> It were in vain for you to attempt to save my life. I commend my
soul to the mercy of God." Obedient to his directions, all that were with
him, save Nicholas Muss or de la Mouche, his faithful German interpreter,
fled to the roof, and escaped under cover of the darkness.</p>

<p>One of Coligny's Swiss guards had been shot at the foot of the stairs.
When Cosseins had removed the barricade of boxes that had been erected
farther up, the Swiss in his own company, whose uniform of green, white,
and black, showed them to belong to the Duke of Anjou, found their
countrymen on the other side, but did them no harm. Cosseins following
them, however, no sooner saw these armed men, than he ordered his
arquebusiers to shoot, and one of them fell dead. It was a German
follower of Guise, named Besme, who first reached and entered Coligny's
chamber, and who for the exploit was subsequently rewarded with the hand
of a natural daughter of the Cardinal of Lorraine. Cosseins, Attin,
Sarlaboux, and others, were behind him. "Is not this the admiral?" said
Besme of the wounded man, whom he found quietly seated and awaiting his
coming. "I am he," Coligny calmly replied. "Young man, thou oughtest to
have respect for my old age and my feebleness; but thou shalt not,
nevertheless, shorten my life."<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> There were those who asserted that
he added: "At least, would that some man, and not this blackguard, put me
to death." But most of the murderers&mdash;and among them Attin, who confessed
that never had he seen any one more assured in the presence of
death&mdash;affirmed that Coligny said nothing beyond the words first
mentioned. No sooner had Besme heard the admiral's reply, than, with a
curse, he struck him with his sword, first in the breast, and then on the
head.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> The rest took part, and quickly despatched him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p><p>In the court below, Guise was impatiently waiting to hear that his
mortal enemy was dead. "Besme," he cried out at last, "have you
finished?" "It is done," the assassin replied. "Monsieur le Chevalier
(the Bastard of Angoulême) will not believe it," again said Guise,
"unless he sees him with his own eyes. Throw him out of the window!"
Besme and Sarlaboux promptly obeyed the command. When the lifeless
remains lay upon the pavement of the court, Henry of Guise stooped down
and with his handkerchief wiped away the blood from the admiral's face.
"I recognize him," he said; "it is he himself!" Then, after ignobly
kicking the face of his fallen antagonist, he went out gayly encouraging
his followers: "Come, soldiers, take courage; we have begun well. Let us
go on to the others, for so the king commands!" And often through the day
Guise repeated the words, "The king commands; it is the king's pleasure;
it is his express command!" Just then a bell was heard, and the cry was
raised that the Huguenots were in arms to kill the king.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<p>As for Admiral Coligny's body, after the head had been cut off by an
Italian of the guard of the Duke de Nevers, the trunk was treated with
every indignity. The hands were cut off, and it was otherwise mutilated
in a shameless manner. Three days was it dragged about the streets by a
band of inhuman boys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> Meantime the head had been carried to the
Louvre, where, after Catharine and Charles had sufficiently feasted their
eyes on the spectacle, it was embalmed and sent to Rome, a grateful
present to the Cardinal of Lorraine and Pope Gregory the Thirteenth.<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a>
It has been questioned whether the ghastly trophy ever reached its
destination. Indeed, the French court seems to have become ashamed of its
inhumanity, and to have regretted that so startling a token of its
barbarous hatred had been allowed to go abroad. Accordingly, soon after
the departure of the courier, a second courier was despatched in great
haste to Mandelot, governor of Lyons, bidding him stop the first and take
away from him the admiral's head. He arrived too late, however; four
hours before Mandelot received the king's letter, "a squire of the Duke
of Guise, named Pauli," had passed through the city, doubtless carrying
the precious relic.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> That it was actually placed in the hands of the
Cardinal of Lorraine at Rome, need not be doubted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coligny's character and work.</div>

<p>Gaspard de Coligny was in his fifty-sixth year at the time of his death.
For twelve years he had been the most prominent man in the Huguenot
party, occupying a position secured to him not more by his resplendent
abilities as a general than by the respect exacted by high moral
principles. With the light and frivolous side of French character he had
little in common. It was to a sterner and more severe class that he
belonged&mdash;a class of which Michel de l'Hospital might be regarded as the
type. Men who had little affinity with them, and bore them still less
resemblance, but who could not fail to admire their excellence, were wont
to liken both the great Huguenot warrior and the chancellor to that Cato
whose grave demeanor and imposing dignity were a perpetual censure upon
the flippancy and lax morality of his countrymen. Although not above the
ordinary height of men, his appearance was dignified and commanding. In
speech he was slow and deliberate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span> His prudence, never carried to the
extreme of over-caution, was signalized on many occasions. Success did
not elate him; reverses did not dishearten him. The siege of the city of
St. Quentin, into which he threw himself with a handful of troops, and
which he long defended against the best soldiers of Spain, displayed on a
conspicuous stage his military sagacity, his indomitable determination,
and the marvellous control he maintained over his followers. It did much
to prevent Philip from reaping more substantial fruits from the brilliant
victory gained by Count Egmont on the feast-day of St. Lawrence.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> It
was, however, above all in the civil wars that his abilities shone forth
resplendent. Equally averse to beginning war without absolute necessity,
and to ending it without securing the objects for which it had been
undertaken, he was the good genius whose wholesome advice was frequently
disregarded, but never without subsequent regret on the part of those who
had slighted it. We have seen, in a former chapter,<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> the touching
account given by Agrippa d'Aubigné of the appeal of the admiral's wife,
which alone was successful in moving him to overcome his almost
invincible repugnance to taking up arms, even in behalf of a cause which
he knew to be most holy. I find a striking confirmation of the accuracy
of the report in a passage of his will, wherein he defends himself from
the calumnies of his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> "And for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>asmuch as I have learned that
the attempt has been made to impute to me a purpose to attack the persons
of the king, the queen, and the king's brothers, I protest before God
that I never had any such will or desire, and that I never was present at
any place where such plans were ever proposed or discussed. And as I have
also been accused of ambition in taking up arms with those of the
reformed religion, I make the same protestation, that only zeal for
religion, together with fear for my own life, compelled me to assume
them. And, indeed, I must confess my weakness, and that the greatest
fault which I have always committed in this respect has been that I have
not been sufficiently alive to the acts of injustice and the slaughter to
which my brethren were subjected, and that the dangers and the traps that
were laid for myself were necessary to move me to do what I have done.
But I also declare before God, that I tried every means in my power, in
order so long as possible to maintain peace, fearing nothing so much as
civil disturbances and wars, and clearly foreseeing that these would
bring after them the ruin of this kingdom, whose preservation I have
always desired and labored for to the utmost of my ability."</p>

<p>To Coligny's strategy too much praise could scarcely be accorded. The
Venetian ambassador, Contarini, in the report of his mission to the
senate, in the early part of the year 1572, expressed his amazement that
the admiral, a simple gentleman with slender resources, had waged war
against his own powerful sovereign, who was assisted by the King of Spain
and by a few German and several Italian princes; and that, in spite of
many battles lost, he preserved so great a reputation that the reiters
and lansquenets never rebelled, although their wages were much in
arrears, and their booty was often lost in adverse combats. He was, in
fact, said the enthusiastic Italian, entitled to be held in higher esteem
than Hannibal, inasmuch as the Carthaginian general retained the respect
of foreign nations by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span> being uniformly victorious; but the admiral
retained it, although his cause was almost always unsuccessful.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>But all Coligny's military achievements pale in the light of his manly
and unaffected piety. It is as a type of the best class among the
Huguenot nobility that he deserves everlasting remembrance. From his
youth he had been plunged in the engrossing pursuits of a soldier's life;
but he was not ashamed, so soon as he embraced the views of the
reformers, to acknowledge the superior claims of religion upon his time
and his allegiance. He gloried in being a Christian. The influence of his
faith was felt in every action of his life. In the busiest part of an
active life, he yet found time for the recognition of God; and, whether
in the camp or in his castle of Châtillon-sur-Loing, he consecrated no
insignificant portion of the day to devotion. Of the ordinary life of
Admiral Coligny, the anonymous author of his Life, who had himself been
an inmate in his house, has left an interesting description, derived from
what he himself saw and heard:</p>

<p>"As soon as he had risen from bed, which was always at an early hour,
putting on his morning-gown, and kneeling, as did those who were with
him, he himself prayed in the form which is customary with the churches
of France. After this, while waiting for the commencement of the sermon,
which was delivered on alternate days, accompanied with psalmody, he gave
audience to the deputies of the churches who were sent to him, or devoted
the time to public business. This he resumed for a while after the
service was over, until the hour for dinner. When that was come, such of
his domestic servants as were not prevented by necessary engagements
elsewhere, met in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span> hall where the table was spread, standing by
which, with his wife at his side, if there had been no preaching service,
he engaged with them in singing a psalm, and then the ordinary blessing
was said.</p>

<p>"On the removal of the cloth, rising and standing with his wife and the
rest of the company, he either returned thanks himself or called on his
minister to do so. Such, also, was his practice at supper, and, finding
that the members of his household could not, without much discomfort,
attend prayers so late as at bedtime&mdash;an hour, besides, which the
diversity of his occupations prevented from being regularly fixed&mdash;his
orders were that, so soon as supper was over, a psalm should be sung and
prayer offered. It cannot be told how many of the French nobility began
to establish this religious order in their own families, after the
example of the admiral, who used often to exhort them to the practice of
true piety, and to warn them that it was not enough for the father of a
family to live a holy and religious life, if he did not by his example
bring all his people to the same rule.</p>

<p>"On the approach of the time for the celebration of the Lord's Supper,
calling together all the members of his household, he told them that he
had to render an account to God, not only of his own life, but also of
their behavior, and reconciled such of them as might have had
differences.... Moreover, he regarded the institution of colleges for
youth, and of schools for the instruction of children, a singular benefit
from God, and called the school a seminary of the church and an
apprenticeship of piety; holding that ignorance of letters had introduced
into both church and state that thick darkness in which the tyranny of
the Pope had had its birth and increase.... This conviction led him to
lay out a large sum in building a college at Châtillon, and there he
maintained three very learned professors of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
respectively, and a number of students.</p>

<p>"There could not be a stronger proof of his integrity, and of the
moderation of his desires with respect to the possession of property,
than that, notwithstanding the high offices he held, and the
opportunities they afforded, as is usual with courtiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span> of attending to
his own interests and acquiring great wealth, he did not increase his
patrimonial estates by a single acre; and, although he was an excellent
economist, yet the number of persons of high rank, and, indeed, of all
conditions, that came to consult him on public affairs from all parts of
France, obliged him to draw largely on the savings effected by his good
management; so that he left to his heirs not less than forty thousand
livres of debts, besides six thousand livres of interest which he paid
annually to his creditors."<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>

<p>Such was the Christian hero whom his enemies represented as breathing out
menaces upon the bed on which Maurevel's arquebuse had laid him, and as
exclaiming: "If my arm is wounded, my head is not. If I have to lose my
arm, I shall get the head of those who are the cause of it. They intended
to kill me; I shall anticipate them." Such was the disinterested patriot
whom, in the infatuation of their lying fabrications, the murderers of
Paris, their hands still reeking with the blood of thousands of women and
children incontestably innocent of any crime laid to the charge of their
husbands or fathers, pictured as plotting the wholesale assassination of
the royal family&mdash;even to the very Henry of Navarre whose wedding he had
come to honor by his presence&mdash;that he might place upon the throne of
France that stubborn heretic, the Prince of Condé!<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murder of Huguenot nobles in the Louvre.</div>

<p>While the murder of Coligny was in course of execution, or but shortly
after, a tragedy not less atrocious was enacted in the royal palace
itself. A number of Huguenot gentlemen of the highest distinction were
lodged in the Louvre. Charles, after the admiral's wound, had suggested
to the King of Navarre that he would do well to invite some of his
friends to act as a guard against any attack that might be made upon him
by the Duke of Guise, whom he characterized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span> as a "mauvois garçon."<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>
Late on Saturday night, as Margaret of Valois informs us in her Memoirs,
and long after she and her husband had retired, these Huguenot lords,
gathered around Henry of Navarre's bed to the number of thirty, had
discussed the occurrences of the last two eventful days, and declared
their purpose to go to the king on the morrow and demand the punishment
of the Guises. Margaret herself had been purposely kept in ignorance of
the plan for the extirpation of the Protestants. For, if the Huguenots
suspected her, because she was a Roman Catholic, the papists suspected
her equally because she had married a Protestant. On parting with her
mother for the night, her elder sister Claude, Duchess of Lorraine, who
happened to be on a visit to the French court, had vainly attempted to
detain Margaret, expressing with tears the apprehension that some evil
would befall her. But Catharine had peremptorily sent her to bed,
assuring her with words which, seen in the light of subsequent
revelations, approach the climax of profanity: "That, if God pleased, she
would receive no injury."<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> So deep was the impression of impending
danger made upon Margaret's mind, that she remained awake, she tells us,
until morning, when her husband arose, saying that he would go and divert
himself with a game of tennis until Charles should awake. After his
departure, the Queen of Navarre, relieved of her misgivings, as the night
was now spent, ordered her maid to lock her door, and composed herself to
sleep.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a></p>

<p>Meantime the Protestant gentlemen who accompanied Navarre, and all the
others who lodged in the Louvre, had been disarmed by Nançay, captain of
the guard. In this defenceless condition ten or twelve of their number
were conducted, one by one, to the gate of the building. Here soldiers
stood in readiness, and despatched them with their halberds as they
successively made their appearance. Such was the fate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span> brave
Pardaillan, of St. Martin, of Boursis, of Beauvais, former tutor of Henry
of Navarre, and of others; some of whom in a loud voice called upon
Charles, whom they saw at a window, an approving spectator of the
butchery, to remember the solemn pledges he had given them. M. de
Piles&mdash;that brave Huguenot captain, whose valor, if it did not save St.
Jean d'Angely in the third civil war, had at least detained the entire
Roman Catholic army for seven weeks before fortifications that were none
of the best, and rendered Moncontour a field barren of substantial
fruits<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>&mdash;was the object of special hatred, and his conduct was
particularly remarked for its magnanimity. Observing among the bystanders
a Roman Catholic acquaintance in whose honor he might perhaps confide, he
stripped himself of his cloak, and would have handed it to him, with the
words: "De Piles makes you a present of this; remember hereafter the
death of him who is now so unjustly put to death!" "Mon capitaine,"
answered the other, fearful of incurring the enmity of Catharine and
Charles, "I am not of the company of these persons. I thank you for your
cloak; but I cannot take it upon such conditions." The next moment M. de
Piles fell, pierced by the halberd of one of the archers of the guard.
"These are the men," cried the murderers at their bloody work, "who
resorted to violence, in order to kill the king afterward."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> One of
the victims marked out for the slaughter escaped the death of his
fellows. Margaret of Valois had not been long asleep, when her slumbers
were rudely disturbed by loud blows struck upon the door, and shouts of
"Navarre! Navarre!" Her attendant, supposing it to be Henry himself,
hastily opened the door; when there rushed in instead, a Huguenot
nobleman, the Viscount de Léran,<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> wounded in the arm by sword and
halberd, and pursued by four archers. In his terror he threw himself on
Margaret's bed, and when she jumped up, in doubt of what could be the
meaning of this strange incident, he clung to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span> night-dress which was
drenched with his blood. Nançay angrily reproved the indiscretion of his
soldiers, and Margaret, leaving the Huguenot in her room to have his
wounds dressed, suffered herself to be conducted to the chamber of her
sister, the Duchess of Lorraine. It was but a few steps; but, on the way,
a Huguenot was killed at three paces' distance from her, and two
others&mdash;the first gentleman of the King of Navarre, and his first
valet-de-chambre&mdash;ran to her imploring her to save their lives. She
sought and obtained the favor on her knees before Catharine and
Charles.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> A few other Huguenots who were in the Louvre were ready to
purchase their lives at any price, even to that of abjuring their faith.
They obtained pardon on promising the king to comply with all his
commands; and this, we are told, "the more easily, as Charles very well
knew that they had little or no religion."<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Navarre and Condé spared.</div>

<p>The King of Navarre and the Prince of Condé were spared, although there
were not wanting those who would gladly have seen the ruin of the family
of Bourbon. Navarre was brother-in-law of Charles, and Condé of the Duke
of Nevers; this may have guaranteed their safety. Both of the young
princes, however, were summoned into the king's presence, where Charles,
acknowledging the murder of Coligny, the great cause of disturbances, and
the similar acts then perpetrated throughout the city, as sanctioned by
his authority, sternly told the two youths that he intended no longer to
tolerate two religions in his dominions. He desired them, therefore, to
conform to that creed which had been professed by all his predecessors,
and which he intended to uphold. They must renounce the profane doctrines
they had embraced, and return to the Catholic and Roman religion. If they
refused, they must expect to suffer the treatment which had just been
experienced by so many others.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>The replies of the two princes were singularly unlike. Henry of Navarre,
bold enough where only physical bravery was demanded, exhibited for the
first time that lamentable absence of moral courage which was to render
his life, in its highest relations, a splendid failure. His countenance
betrayed agitation and faint-heartedness.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> With great
"humility"&mdash;almost whining, it would appear&mdash;he begged that his own life
and the life of Condé might be spared, and reminded Charles of his
promised protection. "He would act," he said, "so as to satisfy his
Majesty; yet he besought him to remember that conscience was a great
thing, and that it was hard to renounce the religion in which one had
been brought up from infancy." On the other hand, Henry of Condé, in no
way abashed,<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> declared "that he could not believe that his royal
cousin intended to violate a promise confirmed by so solemn an oath. As
to fealty, he had always been an obedient subject of the king, and would
ever be. Touching his religion, if the king had given him the exercise of
its worship, God had given him the knowledge of it; and to Him he must
needs give up an account. So far as his body and his possessions were
concerned, they were in the king's hands to dispose of as he might
choose. Yet it was his own determination to remain constant in his
religion, which he would always maintain to be the true religion, even
should he be compelled to lay down his life for it." So stout an answer
kindled the anger of Charles, who was in no mood to meet with opposition.
He called Condé "a rebel," "a seditious man," and "the son of a seditious
father," and warned him that he would lose his head, if, within three
days, he should not think better of the matter.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The massacre becomes general.</div>

<p>And now the great bell of the "Palais de Justice" pealed forth the
tocsin. About the Louvre the work of blood had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span> begun when Catharine,
impatient, and fearful lest Charles's resolution should again waver at
the last moment, gave orders to anticipate the appointed time by ringing
the bell of the neighboring church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois. But now
the loud and unusual clangor from the tower of the parliament house
carried the warning far and wide. All Paris awoke. The conspirators
everywhere recognized the stipulated signal, and spread among the excited
townsmen the wildest and most extravagant reports. A foul plot, formed by
the Huguenots, against the king, his mother, and his brothers, had come
to light. They had killed more than fifteen of the royal guards. The
king, therefore, commanded that quarter should not be given to a single
Huguenot.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<p>Nothing more was needed to inflame the popular hatred of the Huguenots,
nor to prepare the rabble for an indiscriminate slaughter of the
Protestants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">La Rochefoucauld and Téligny fall.</div>

<p>Among the earliest victims of this day of carnage was Count de la
Rochefoucauld. This witty and lively young noble had been in the Louvre
until a late hour on Saturday night, diverting himself with the king,
with whom he was a great favorite. Apparently in his anxiety to save La
Rochefoucauld's life, Charles invited, and even urged him, to spend the
night in the royal "garde-robe;" but the count, suspecting no danger,
insisted on returning to his lodgings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span> while the king reluctantly
abandoned his boon companion to his fate, rather than betray his secret.
Early awakened from his sleep at his lodgings by loud knocking at the
door and by demands for admission in the king's name, and seeing a band
of masked men enter, he recalled Charles's threat at parting, that he
would come and administer to him a whipping. The practical joke would not
have been unlike many of the mad antics of the royal jester, and La
Rochefoucauld, addressing himself to the person whom he supposed to be
his Majesty in disguise, begged him to treat him with humanity. His
deception was not long continued; for the maskers, after rifling his
trunks, drew him from his place of concealment and murdered him. His
lifeless body was dragged through the streets of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>Téligny was, perhaps, even more unfortunate than the rest, because he
awoke too late to the fact that his own blind confidance in the word of a
faithless prince had been a chief instrument of involving his
father-in-law and his friends in destruction. He was among the first to
pay the penalty of his credulity. More than one of the parties sent to
destroy him, it is said, overcome by compassion for his youth and manly
beauty, or by respect for his graceful manners and extraordinary
learning, left their commission unexecuted. To avoid further peril, he
ascended to the roof, from which he made his way to an adjoining house;
but he had not gone far before he was seen and shot with an arquebuse by
one of the Duke of Anjou's guards.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-defense of a few nobles.</div>

<p>The Huguenots, attacked in the midst of their slumbers by the courtiers
and the soldiers of the royal guard,<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> among whom were prominent the
Swiss of Charles or his brother, or by the people of Paris, who every
moment swelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> the ranks of the assassins, were too much taken by
surprise to offer even the slightest resistance. Guerchy, the same
gentleman who had offered his services to Coligny the night before, is
almost the only man reported to have fought for his life. With his sword
in his right hand, and winding his cloak around his left arm, he defended
himself for a long time, though the breastplates of his enemies were
proof against his blows. At last, he fell, overborne by numbers.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>
The Lieutenant de la Mareschaussée, if not more determined, was better
prepared for the combat. All day long, with a single soldier as his
comrade, he defended his house against the assailants, expecting at every
moment to be relieved from his perilous situation by the king. But, far
from meriting such confidence on the part of his subjects, Charles was
indignant at his prolonged resistance, and sent a powerful detachment of
guards, with orders to bring him the lieutenant's head. The brave
Huguenot, however, still maintained the unequal siege, and fought till
his last breath. The soldiers had only the poor satisfaction of pillaging
his house, of dragging his sick daughter naked through the streets until
she died of maltreatment, and of wounding and imprisoning his wife.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Victims of personal hatred.</div>

<p>Personal hatred, jealousy, cupidity, mingled with religious and political
zeal, and private ends were attained in fulfilling the king's murderous
commands. Bussy d'Amboise, meeting his Protestant cousin, the Marquis de
Renel (half-brother of the late Prince of Porcien), by a well-directed
blow with his poniard rid himself of an unpleasant suit at law which
Renel had come to Paris to prosecute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adventure of young La Force.</div>

<p>The case of Caumont de la Force was still more revolting. His daughter,
Madame de la Châtaigneraie, in accordance with the shameless code of
morals in vogue at the French court, had taken for her lover Archan,
captain of the guard of Henry of Anjou; and it was to gratify her
covetousness that Archan obtained from the Duke the order to despatch La
Force and his two sons. The plan was successfully executed so far as the
father and his elder son were concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span> The second, a boy of twelve,
escaped by his remarkable presence of mind and self-control. Certain that
his youth would excite no pity in the breast of his inhuman assailants,
when his father and his brother fell at his side and he perceived himself
covered with their blood, he dropped down with the exclamation that he
was dead. So perfectly did he counterfeit death, all that long day, that,
although his body was examined by successive bands of plunderers, and
deprived not only of every valuable, but even of its clothing, he did not
by a motion betray that he was alive. Most of these persons applauded the
crime. It was well, they said, to kill the little wolves with the
greater. But, toward evening, a more humane person came, who, while
engaged in drawing off a stocking which had been left on the boy's foot,
gave expression to his abhorrence of the bloody deed. To his astonishment
the boy raised his head, and whispered, "I am not dead." The
compassionate man at once commanded him not to stir, and went home; but
as soon as it was dark he returned with a cloak, which he threw about
young La Force's shoulders, and bade him follow. It was no easy matter to
thread the streets unmolested; but his guide dispelled the suspicions of
those who questioned him respecting the boy by declaring that it was his
nephew whom he had found drunk, and was going to whip soundly for it. In
the end the young nobleman reached the arsenal, where his relative,
Marshal Biron, was in command. Even there, however, the avarice of his
unnatural sister pursued him. Vexed that, on account of his preservation,
she must fail to secure the entire inheritance of the family, Madame de
la Châtaigneraie tried to effect herself what she had not been able to do
by means of another; she visited the marshal in the arsenal, and, after
expressing great joy that her brother had been saved, begged to be
permitted to see and care for him. Biron thought it necessary, in order
to preserve the boy's life, to deny her request.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitiless butchery.</div>

<p>The frenzy that had fallen upon Paris affected all classes alike. Every
feeling of pity seemed to have been blotted out. Natural affection
disappeared. A man's foes were those of his own household. On the plea of
religious zeal the most barbarous acts were committed. Spire Niquet, a
poor bookbinder, whose scanty earnings barely sufficed to support the
wants of his seven children, was half-roasted in a bonfire made of his
own books, and then dragged to the river and drowned.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> The weaker
sex was not spared in the universal carnage, and, as in a town taken by
assault, suffered outrages that were worse than death. Matron and maiden
alike welcomed as merciful the blow that liberated them from an existence
now rendered insupportable. Women approaching maternity were selected for
more excruciating torments, and savage delight was exhibited in
destroying the unborn fruit of the womb. Nor was any rank respected.
Madame d'Yverny, the niece of Cardinal Briçonnet, was recognized, as she
fled, by the costly underclothing that appeared from beneath the shabby
habit of a nun which she had assumed; and, after suffering every
indignity, upon her refusal to go to mass, was thrown from a bridge into
the Seine and drowned.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Occasionally the women rivalled the cruelty
of the men. A poor carpenter, of advanced age, with whom the author of
the "Tocsain contre les massacreurs" was personally acquainted, had been
taken by night and cast into the river. He swam, however, to a bridge,
and succeeded in climbing up by its timbers, and so fled naked to the
house of a relative near the "Cousture Sainte Catherine,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span> where his wife
had taken refuge. But, instead of welcoming him, his wife drove him away,
and he was soon recaptured and killed.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> It is related that the
daughter of one Jean de Coulogne, a mercer of the "Palais," betrayed her
own mother to death, and subsequently married one of the murderers.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>
The very innocence of childhood furnished no sufficient protection&mdash;so
literally did the pious Catholics of Paris interpret the oft-repeated
exhortations of their holy father to exterminate not only the roots of
heresy, but the very fibres of the roots.<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> Two infants, whose
parents had just been murdered, were carried in a hod and cast into the
Seine. A little girl was plunged naked in the blood of her father and
mother, with horrible oaths and threats that, if she should become a
Huguenot, the like fate would befall her. And a crowd of boys, between
nine and ten years of age, was seen dragging through the streets the body
of a babe yet in its swaddling-clothes, which they had fastened to a rope
by means of a belt tied about its neck.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>The bodies of the more inconspicuous victims lay for hours in whatever
spot they happened to be killed; but the court required ocular
demonstration that the leaders of the Huguenots who had been most
prominent in the late wars were really dead. Accordingly the naked
corpses of Soubise, of Guerchy, of Beaudiné, d'Acier's brother, and of
others, were dragged from all quarters to the square in front of the
Louvre. There, as an indignant contemporary writes, extended in a long
row, they lay exposed to the view of the varlets, of whom when alive they
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span> been the terror.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Cruelty and lust are twin sisters: when the
one is at hand, the other is generally not far distant. The court of
Catharine de' Medici was noted for its impurity, as it was infamous for
its recklessness of human life. It was not out of keeping with its
general reputation that toward evening a bevy of ladies&mdash;among them the
queen mother&mdash;tripped down the palace stairs to feast their eyes upon the
sight of the uncovered dead.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> Indeed, the king, the queen mother,
and their intimate friends seemed to be in an ecstasy of joy. They
indulged in boisterous laughter<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> as the successive reports of the

Montpensier was surpassed by no one in his zealous advocacy of the

he rode through the streets, "if he wishes to prove himself a good
servant to the king."<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> Tavannes, if we may believe Brantôme's
account, endeavored to rival him, and, all day long, as he rode about
amid the carnage, amused himself by facetiously crying to the people:
"Bleed! Bleed! The doctors say that bleeding is as good in the month of
August as in May."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>

<p>Of the Duke of Alençon it was noticed that, alone of Catha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>rine's sons,
he took no part in the massacre. The Protestants even regarded him as
their friend, and the rumor was current that the pity he exhibited
excited the indignation of his mother and brothers. Indeed, Catharine, it
was said, openly told him that, if he ventured to meddle with her plans,
she would put him in a sack and throw him into the river.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wonderful escapes.</div>

<p>Of the pastors of the Church of Paris, it was noticed as a remarkable
circumstance that but two&mdash;Buirette and Desgorris&mdash;were killed; for it
was certain that no lives were more eagerly sought than theirs.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> But
several Protestant pastors had wonderful escapes. The celebrated
D'Espine&mdash;the converted monk who took part in the Colloquy of Poissy&mdash;was
in company with Madame d'Yverny when her disguise was discovered, but he
was not recognized.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> In the case of Merlin, chaplain of Admiral
Coligny, the divine interposition seemed almost as distinct as in that of

request, and clambering over the roof of a neighboring house, he fell
through an opening into a garret full of hay. Not daring to show himself,
since he knew not whether he would encounter friends or foes, he remained
for three days in this retreat, his sole food an egg which a hen daily
laid within his reach.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>The future minister of Henry the Fourth, Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of
Sully, at this time a boy of twelve and a student in the college of
Burgundy in Paris, has left us in his "Economies royales" a thrilling
account of his escape. Awakened, about three o'clock in the morning, by
the uproar in the streets, his tutor and his valet-de-chambre went out to
learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span> occasion of it, and never returned. They were doubtless among
the first victims. Sully's trembling host&mdash;a Protestant who consented
through fear to abjure his faith&mdash;now came in, and advised the youth to
save his life by going to mass. Sully was not prepared to take this
counsel, and, so putting on his scholar's gown, he ventured upon the
desperate step of trying to reach the college. A horrible scene presented
itself to view. Everywhere men were breaking into houses, or slaughtering
their captives in the public streets, while the cry of "Kill the
Huguenots" was heard on all sides. Sully himself owed his preservation to
two thick volumes of "Heures"&mdash;Romish books of devotion&mdash;which he had the
presence of mind to take under his arm, and which effectually disarmed
the suspicions of the three successive bands of soldiers that stopped
him. At the college, after with difficulty gaining admission, he incurred
still greater danger. Happily the principal, M. Du Faye, was a
kind-hearted man. In vain was he urged, by two priests who were his
guests, to surrender the Huguenot boy to death, saying that the order was
to massacre even the very babes at the breast. Du Faye would not consent;
and after having secretly kept Sully locked up for three days in a
closet, he found means to restore him to his friends.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of the philosopher Ramus.</div>

<p>No loss was more sensibly felt by the scientific world than that of the
learned Pierre de la Ramée, or Ramus, a philosopher second to none of his
day. The professor might possibly have escaped if his only offence had
been his Protestant views; but Ramus had had the temerity to attack
Aristotle, and to attempt to reform the faulty pronunciation of the Latin
language. For these unpardonable sins he was tracked to the cellar in
which he had hidden, by a band of robbers under the guidance of Jacques
Charpentier, a jealous rival, with whom he had had acrimonious
discussions. After being compelled to give up a considerable sum of
money, he was despatched with daggers, and thrown from an upper window
into the court of his college. Never was philosophic heterodoxy more
thoroughly punished; for if the whipping, dragging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span> through the filthy
streets, and dismembering of a corpse by indignant students with the
approval of their teachers, could atone for such grave errors, the anger
of the illustrious Stagirite must have been fully appeased. If anything
can clearly exhibit the depth of moral degradation to which Roman
Catholic France had fallen, it is the fact that Charpentier unblushingly
accepted the praise which was liberally showered upon him for his
participation in this disgraceful affair.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">President Pierre de la Place.</div>

<p>Scarcely less signal a misfortune to France was the murder of Pierre de
la Place, president of the Cour d'Aides, whose excellent "Commentaries on
the State of Religion and the Republic" constitute one of our best guides
through the short reign of Francis the Second and the early part of the
reign of Charles the Ninth. This eminent jurist, even more distinguished
as a writer on Christian morals than as a historian, had first embraced
the Reformation at a time when the recent martyrdom of Anne du Bourg
served as a significant reminder of the perils attending a profession of
Protestant views. President de la Place had been visited in his house
early in the morning, on the first day of the massacre, by Captain
Michel, an arquebusier of the king, who, entering boldly with his weapons
and with the white napkin bound on his left arm, informed him of the
death of Coligny, and the fate in reserve for the rest of the Huguenots.
The soldier pretended that the king wished to exempt La Place from the
general slaughter, and bade him accompany him to the Louvre. However, a
gift of a thousand crowns induced the fellow instead to lead the
president's daughter and her husband to a place of safety in the house of
a Roman Catholic friend. But La Place himself, after having applied at
three different houses belonging to persons of his acquaintance and been
denied admission, was compelled to return to his home and there await his
doom. A day passed, during which La Place and his wife were subjected to
constant alarms. At length new orders came in the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span> name, enjoining
upon him without fail to repair instantly to the palace. The meaning was
unmistakable; it was the road to death. But neither the Huguenot's piety
nor his courage failed him. He gently raised his wife, who had fallen on
her knees to beg the messenger to save her husband's life, and reminded
her that she should have recourse to God alone, not to an arm of flesh.
And he sternly rebuked his eldest son, who, in a moment of weakness, had
placed a white cross on his hat, in the hope of saving his life. "The
true cross we must wear," he said, "is the trials and afflictions sent to
us by God as sure pledges of the bliss and eternal life He has prepared
for His own followers." It was with unruffled composure that he bade his
weeping friends farewell. His apprehensions were soon realized; he was
despatched by murderers who had been waiting for him, and before long his
body was floating down the Seine toward the sea.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Regnier and Vezins.</div>

<p>From such instances of inhumanity it is a relief to turn to one of a few
incidents wherein the finer feelings triumphed over prejudice, difference
of religious tenets, and even personal hatred. There were in Paris two
gentlemen, named Vezins and Regnier, of good families in the province of
Quercy in southern France. Both were equally distinguished for their
valor; but their dispositions were singularly unlike, for while the
Huguenot Regnier was noted for his gentle manners, the Roman Catholic
Vezins, who was lieutenant of the governor, the Viscount of Villars, had
acquired unenviable notoriety because of his ferocity. Between the two
there had for some time existed a mortal feud, which their common friends
had striven in vain to heal. While the massacre was at its height,
Regnier was visited by his enemy, Vezins. The latter, after effecting an
entrance into the house by breaking down the door, fiercely ordered the
Huguenot&mdash;who, well assured that his last hour was come, had fallen upon
his knees to im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>plore the mercy of God&mdash;to rise and follow him. A horse
stood saddled at the door, upon which Regnier was told to mount. In his
enemy's train he rode unharmed through the streets of Paris, then through
the gates of the city. Still Vezins, without vouchsafing a word of
explanation, kept on his way toward Cahors, the capital of Quercy,
whither he had been despatched by the government.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> For many
successive days the journey lasted. The prisoner was well guarded, but he
was also well lodged and fed. At last the party reached the very castle
of Regnier, and here his captor broke the long silence. "As you have
seen," said he, "it would have depended only on myself to take advantage
of the opportunity which I have long been seeking; but I should be
ashamed to avenge myself in this way upon a man so brave as you. In
settling our quarrel I desire that the danger shall be equal. Be well
assured that you will find me as ready to decide our dispute in a manner
becoming gentlemen, as I have been eager to save you from inevitable
destruction." It need scarcely be said that the Huguenot could not find
words sufficiently strong to express his gratitude; but Vezins merely
replied: "I leave it to you to choose whether you wish me to be your
friend or your enemy; I saved your life only to enable you to make your

he ever consent even to take back the horse upon which he had brought
Regnier in safety so many leagues.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Escape of Montgomery and Chartres.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles himself fires at them from the Louvre.</div>

<p>A number of the Huguenot noblemen were lodged on the southern side of the
Seine, outside of the walls, in the Faubourg Saint Germain. Count
Montgomery, the Vidame of Chartres, Beauvoir la Nocle, and Frontenay, a
member of the powerful Rohan family, were among the most distinguished.
After the admiral, there were certainly no Huguenots whom Catharine was
more anxious to destroy than Montgomery and Chartres. Accordingly the
massacre, which began near the Louvre, was to have been executed
simultaneously upon them, and the work was intrusted to M. de Maugi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>ron.
But the delay of the Roman Catholics saved them. Marcel, the former
prévôt des marchands, who had been instructed to furnish one thousand
men, was not ready in time; and Dumas, who was to have acted as guide,
overslept the appointed hour. About five o'clock in the morning a
Huguenot succeeded in swimming across the river, and carried to
Montgomery the first tidings of the events of the last two hours. The
count at once notified his comrades, but, although there were among them
those who had been most urgent to leave Paris immediately after
Maurevel's attack upon Coligny, few of the nobles would harbor the
thought that Charles was so lost to honor as to have plotted the
assassination of his invited guests. They preferred to believe that the
king was himself in danger through a sudden commotion occasioned by the
Guises. Acting upon this theory, the Huguenots proceeded in a body toward
the Seine, intending to cross and lend assistance to the royal cause;
but, on reaching the river's bank, they were speedily undeceived. They
saw a band of two hundred soldiers of the royal guard coming toward them
in boats, and discharging their arquebuses, with cries of "<i>Tue!
Tue!</i>"&mdash;"Kill! Kill!" Charles himself was descried at a window of the
Louvre, looking with approval upon the scene. There is good authority
also, for the story that, in his eagerness to exterminate the Huguenots,
Charles snatched an arquebuse from the hand of an attendant, and fired at
them, exclaiming, "Let us shoot, <i>mort Dieu</i>, they are fleeing!"<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>Montgomery and his companions had by this time recognized their mistake,
and hesitated no longer to flee from the perfidious capital. They
promptly took to horse, and rode hard to reach Normandy and the sea. This
part of the prey was, however, too precious to be permitted to escape.
Accordingly, Guise, Aumale, the Bastard of Angoulême, and a number of
"gentilhommes tueurs," started in pursuit. But an accident prevented them
from overtaking the Huguenots. When Guise and his party reached the Porte
de Bussy<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a>&mdash;the gate leading from the city into the faubourg in which
the Protestants had been lodging&mdash;which was closed in accordance with the
king's orders, they found that they had been provided by mistake with the
wrong key, and the delay experienced in finding the right one afforded
Montgomery an advantage in the race, of which he made good use.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The massacre continues.</div>

<p>The carnival of blood, which had been so successfully ushered in on that
ill-starred Sunday of August, was maintained on the succeeding days with
little abatement of its frenzied excitement. Paris soon resembled a vast
charnel-house. The dead or dying lay in the open streets and squares,
they blocked the doors and carriage-ways, they were heaped in the
courtyards. When the utmost that impotent passion could do to these
lifeless remains was accomplished, the Seine became the receptacle.
Besides those Huguenots whom their murderers dragged to the bridges or
wharves to despatch by drowning, both by day and by night wagons laden
with the corpses of men and women, and even of young children, were
driven down to the river and emptied of their human freight. But the
current of the crooked Seine refused to carry away from the capital all
these evidences of guilt. The shores of its first curve, from Paris to
the bridge of St. Cloud, were covered with putrefying remains, which the
municipality were compelled to inter, through fear of their generating a
pestilence. And so we read, in the registers of the Hôtel-de-Ville, of a
payment of fifteen livres tournois, on the ninth of September, for the
burial of the dead bodies found near the Convent of Chaillot, and of a
second payment of twenty livres on the twenty-third, for the burial of
eleven hundred more, near Chaillot, Auteuil, and St. Cloud.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Not a popular movement.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Plunder of the rich.</div>

<p>The massacre was not in its origin a popular outbreak. It sprang from the
ambition and vindictive passions of the queen mother, and others, whom
the ministers of a corrupt religion had long accustomed to the idea that
the extermination of heretics is not a sin, but the highest type of
piety. The people were called in only as assistants. Probably the first
intention was only to hold the municipal forces in readiness to overcome
any resistance which the Protestants might offer. But the massacre
succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations of the conspirators. Very
few of the victims defended themselves or their property; scarcely one
Roman Catholic was slain. And now the populace, having had a taste of
blood, could no longer be restrained. Whether the plunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span> of the
Protestants entered into the original calculations of Catharine and her
advisers, may perhaps be doubted. But there is no question as to the turn
which the affair soon took in the minds of those engaged in it. Pillage
was not always countenanced by church and state: as a violation of the
second table of the Law, it was, under ordinary circumstances, atoned for
by penance and ecclesiastical censures; as a breach of the royal edicts,
it was likely to be punished with hanging or still more painful modes of
execution. Consequently, when by furnishing arms the civil power
authorized the most severe measures against those whom it accused of foul
conspiracy against the king, and when the professed minister of Christ
and His gospel of peace blessed the work of exterminating God's enemies
and the king's, there was no lack of men willing to profit by the rare
and unexpected opportunity. Nor did the courtiers disdain dishonest gain.
The Duke of Anjou was known to have enriched himself by the plunder of
the shop of Baduère, the king's jeweller.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> Noblemen, besides robbing
their victims of money, extorted from them, in return for a promise to
spare their lives, deeds of valuable lands, or papers resigning in their
favor high offices in the government. It was frequently the case that,
after giving such presents, the Huguenot was put out of the way at once,
in order to prevent him from ever retracting. Thus, Martial de Loménie, a
secretary of the king, was murdered in prison, after having resigned his
office in favor of Marshal Retz, and sold to him his estate of
Versailles, at such a price as the latter chose to name, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span> vain
hope that this would secure him liberty and life.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> The extent to
which robbery was carried on the occasion of the massacre is reluctantly
conceded in the pamphlet, which was published immediately after, as an
apology of the court for the hideous crime; and an attempt is made to
justify it, which is worthy of the source from which it drew its
inspiration: "Now this good-will of the people to sustain and defend its
prince, to espouse his quarrel, and to hate those who are not of his
religion, is very praiseworthy; and if in this execution [the massacre]
some pillaging has taken place, we must excuse the fury of a people
impelled by a worthy zeal&mdash;a zeal hard to be restrained and bridled when
once excited."<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Orders issued to lay down arms.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Little heed given to them.</div>

<p>But, despite panegyrists, the massacre had not been in progress many
hours before the very magistrates of the city appear to have become
apprehensive lest the movement might assume dangerous dimensions. It was
only about eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, as the registers of the
Hôtel de Ville inform us, when Charles was waited upon by the prévôt des
marchands and the échevins. They came to inform him that "a number of
persons, partly belonging to the suite of his Majesty, partly to that of
the princes, princesses, and lords of the court&mdash;gentlemen, archers of
the king's body-guard, soldiers of his suite, as well as all sorts of
people mingled with them and under their authority&mdash;were plundering and
pillaging many houses and killing many persons in the streets." This was
certainly no news to Charles; but as he desired, now that the massacre
had begun, not to enrich the Roman Catholic inhabitants of Paris, but to
fill his own coffers, he deemed it best to prohibit any further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span> action
on their part, and to leave the rest of the work to his own commissioned
servants. Accordingly the municipal authorities were directed to ride
through the city with all the troops at their disposal, and to see to it,
both by day and night, that the bloodshed and robbery should cease. "Sir
William Guerrier"&mdash;thus runs one of the commissions to the "quarteniers"
issued from the central bureau of the city, in pursuance of these
directions&mdash;"give commandment to all burgesses and inhabitants of your
quarter, who to-day have taken up arms <i>according to the king's order</i>,
to lay them down, and to retire and remain quietly in their houses, ...
according to the king's command conveyed to us by my Lord of Nevers." And
this document is accompanied with another, of the same date, applying to
soldiers of the guard or others, who should pillage or maltreat
Protestants, and threatening them with punishment. Such a proclamation,
it is well known, was made by trumpet at about five o'clock that
afternoon. The registers tell us that the instructions were so well
carried out that all disorder "was at once appeased and ceased." They
contain, however, a distinct refutation of this falsehood, in the
frequent repetition of similar orders and the variety of forms in which
the same statements are made on subsequent days. Again and again does the
king direct that soldiers be placed at the head of every street to
prevent robbery and murder;<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> the guards either were never posted,
or, as is more likely, became foremost in the work which they were sent
to repress. Indeed, the instructions given on Monday to visit all the
houses in the city and its suburbs where there were any Protestants, and
obtain their names and surnames,<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> afforded an opportunity which was
not permitted to slip by unimproved, for the exaction of heavy bribes, as
well as for more open plunder and violence. So notorious was it, nearly a
week after the butchery began, that the massacre had only abated in
intensity, that, on the thirtieth of August, meas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>ures were adopted to
prevent any wrong from being done to foreign merchants sojourning in
Paris, and especially to the German, English, and Flemish students of the
university.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Miracle of the "Cimetière des Innocents."</div>

<p>The smile of Heaven, it was said by the Roman Catholic clergy, rested
upon the effort to extirpate heresy in France. They convinced the people
of the truth of their assertion by pointing to an unusual phenomenon
which they declared to be evidently miraculous. In the Cimetière des
Innocents and before a small chapel of the Virgin Mary, there grew a
white hawthorn, which, according to some accounts, had for several years
been to all appearance dead. Great then was the surprise of those who, on
the eventful St. Bartholomew's Day, beheld the tree covered with a great
profusion of blossoms as fragrant as those flowers which the hawthorn
usually puts forth in May. It was true that no good reason could be
assigned why the wonder might not with greater propriety be explained, as
the Protestants afterward suggested, rather as a mark of Heaven's
sympathy with oppressed innocence. But no doubts entered the minds of the
Parisian ecclesiastics. They spread abroad the fame of the prodigy. They
rang the church-bells in token of joy, and invited the blood-stained
populace to witness the sight, and gain new courage in their murderous
work. It may well be doubted whether either the hawthorn or the virgin of
the neighboring chapel wrought the wonderful cures recorded by the curate
of Mériot.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> But certainly the reported intervention of Heaven
setting its seal upon treacherous assassination prolonged the slaughter
of Huguenots. "It seemed," says Claude Haton, reflecting the popular
belief, "that God, by this miracle, approved and accepted as
well-pleasing to Him the Catholic uprising and the death of His great
enemy the admiral and his followers, who for twelve years had been
audaciously rending His seamless coat, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span> His true Church and His
Bride."<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> And so, what with the encouragement afforded by the
wonderful thorn-tree of the Cimetière des Innocents&mdash;what with the
continuous fair weather, which was interpreted after the same manner, the
task of extirpating the heretical Huguenots was prosecuted with a
perseverance that never flagged. It is true that the greater part of the
work was done in the first three or four days; but it was not terminated
for several weeks, and many a Huguenot, coming out of his place of
concealment with the hope that time might have caused the passions of his
enemies to become less violent, was murdered in cold blood by those who
coveted his property. Several thousand persons were butchered in Paris
alone during the first few days, besides these later victims; precisely
how many, it is useless and perhaps impossible to fix with
certainty.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's first letter to Mandelot.</div>

<p>Meantime it became necessary to explain to the world the extraordinary
tragedy which had been enacted on so conspicuous a stage. Each of the
different parties to the nefarious compact, with that easy faith which
characterizes great criminals, had expected to satisfy its own resentment
at the sole expense of the honor and reputation of the others. The king
and his mother, while securing the death of Coligny and a few other
personal enemies, were not unwilling to have the world believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span> that the
entire occurrence had been an outburst of the old animosity of the Guises
against the Châtillons. In fact, this was distinctly stated in the
circular letter of Charles IX., despatched on the very Sunday on which
the massacre began, to the governors of the principal cities of the
realm. "Monsieur de Mandelot"&mdash;so runs one of these extraordinary
epistles&mdash;"you have learned what I wrote to you, the day before
yesterday, respecting the wounding of the admiral, and how that I was
about to do my utmost in the investigation of the case and the punishment
of the guilty, wherein nothing has been forgotten. Since then it has
happened that the members of the house of Guise, and the other lords and
gentlemen who are their adherents, and who have no small influence in
this city, as everybody knows, having received certain information that
the friends of the admiral intended to avenge this wound upon them&mdash;since
they suspected them of being its cause and occasion&mdash;became so much
excited that, between the one party and the other, there arose a great
and lamentable commotion. The body of guards which had been posted around
the admiral's house was overpowered, and he was killed with some other
gentlemen, as there have also been others massacred in various parts of
this city. This was done so furiously that it was impossible to apply
such a remedy as could have been desired; for I had as much as I could do
in employing my guards and other forces to retain my superiority in this
castle of the Louvre,<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> so as afterward to take measures for allaying
the commotion throughout the city. At the present hour it has, thank God,
subsided! It occurred through the private quarrel which has long existed
between these two houses. Always foreseeing that some bad consequences
would result from it, I have heretofore done all that I could to appease
it, as every one knows. There is in this nothing leading to the rupture
of the Edict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span> Pacification, which, on the contrary, I intend to be
maintained as much as ever."<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></p>

<p>In view of the undeniable fact that Charles affixed his signature to this
letter in the midst of a horrible massacre for which he himself had given
the signal, which he still directed, and concerning whose progress he
received hourly bulletins from the municipal authorities, it must be
admitted that the king showed himself no novice in the ignoble art of
shameless misrepresentation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Guise throws the responsibility on the king.</div>

<p>Guise, on his part, was not less solicitous to relieve himself of
responsibility, and to lay the burden upon the king's shoulders. We have
seen that, at the very moment of Coligny's assassination, he began to
repeat the words: "It is the king's pleasure; it is his express command!"
as his warrant for the crime. As the massacre grew in extent he and his
associates became more reluctant to be held accountable for it,<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> and
at last they forced Charles to acknowledge himself its sole author. The
queen mother and Anjou, it is said, were mainly instrumental in leading
the monarch to take this unexpected step. His original intention had been
to compel the Guises to leave the capital immediately after the death of
Coligny&mdash;a movement which would have given color to the theory of their
guilt. But it was not difficult for Catharine and Henry to convince him
that by so doing he would only render more irreconcilable the enmity
between the Guises and the Montmorencies, who plainly exhibited their
intention to exact vengeance for the death of their illustrious kinsman,
the admiral. In short, he would purchase brief respite from trouble at
the price of a fresh civil war, more cruel than any which had
preceded.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Lit de Justice."</div>

<p>It was on Tuesday morning, the twenty-sixth of August, that the king
formally and publicly assumed the weighty responsibility. After hearing a
solemn mass, to render thanks to Almighty God for his happy deliverance
from his enemies, Charles, accompanied by his brothers, the Dukes of
Anjou and Alençon, by the King of Navarre, and by a numerous body of his
principal lords, proceeded to the parliament house, and there, in the
presence of all the chambers, held his "Lit de Justice."<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> He opened
this extraordinary meeting by an address, in which he dilated upon the
intolerable insults he had, from his very childhood, experienced at the
hands of Coligny, and many other culprits, who had made religion a
pretext for rebellion. His attempts to secure peace by large concessions
had emboldened Coligny so far that he had at last ventured to conspire to
kill him, his mother, and his brothers, and even the King of Navarre,
although a Huguenot like himself; intending to place the Prince of Condé
upon the throne, and subsequently to put him also out of the way, and
appropriate the regal authority after the destruction of the entire royal
family. In order to ward off so horrible a blow, he had, he said, been
compelled to resort to extreme measures of rigor. He desired all men to
know that the steps taken on the preceding Sunday for the punishment of
the guilty had been in accordance with his orders. He is even reported to
have gone farther, and to have invoked the aid of parliament in
condemning the memory and confiscating the property of those against whom
he had alleged such abominable crimes.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Christopher de Thou.</div>

<p>To this allocution the parliament replied with all servility. Christopher
de Thou, the first president, lauded the prudence of a monarch who had
known how to bear patiently repeated insults, and at last to crush a
conspiracy so dangerous to the quiet of the realm. And he quoted with
approval the infamous apothegm of Louis the Eleventh: "<i>Qui nescit
dissimulare, nescit regnare.</i>" The solitary suggestion that breathed any
manly spirit was that of Pibrac, the "avocat-général," to the effect that
orders should be published to put an end to the work of murder and
robbery&mdash;a request which Charles readily granted.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> Never had the
supreme tribunal of justice abased itself more ignobly than when it
listened so complaisantly to the king, and approved without qualification
an organized massacre perpetrated unblushingly under its very eyes. As
for the distinguished man who lent himself to be the mouthpiece of
adulation worse than slavish, we are less inclined to commiserate the
difficulty of his position than to pity the ingenuous historian who
strives to touch leniently upon a fault of his father which he can
neither conceal nor palliate.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> We may credit his assertion that his
father remonstrated with the king in private with respect to that for
which he had praised him in public, and that Christopher de Thou marked
his detestation of that ill-starred day by applying to it the lines of
Statius:</p>

<p>But we cannot forget that this was not the first time that Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>topher
de Thou "accommodated" his words or his actions to the supposed
"exigencies of the times." He was a member of that commission that
sentenced Louis of Condé to death, in deference to the desires of another
king and his uncles, the Guises; and the prince would doubtless have lost
his head in consequence, but for the sudden death of Francis the Second.
Since that time he had repeatedly acquiesced in the bloody sentences of
the Parisian parliament. His voice was never heard opposing the
proscription instituted in the late civil wars, even in the case of the
atrocious sentence against Gaspard de Coligny. If we concede to his son
that no one was of a less sanguinary or of a milder disposition than
President De Thou, we must also insist that few judges on the bench
displayed less magnanimity or conscientiousness.<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ineffectual effort to inculpate Coligny.</div>

<p>But it was not a simple congratulatory address that Charles, or his
mother, required of his parliament. Tyrannical power is rarely satisfied
with the mere acquiescence of servile judges; it demands, and ordinarily
obtains from them, a positive indorsement of its schemes of successful
villainy. It was necessary&mdash;especially, as we shall see later, after the
cry of horror was heard that rose toward heaven from all parts of Europe
on receipt of the tidings of the massacre in Paris and elsewhere&mdash;to
palliate its atrocity by affixing to the slain Huguenots, and above all
to Coligny, a note of rebellious and murderous designs against the king
and the royal family. And here again the Parliament of Paris was as
pliant as its rulers could desire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span> Coligny's papers, both in Paris and
at Châtillon-sur-Loing, were subjected to close scrutiny; but nothing
could be discovered to warrant the suspicion that any seditious design
had ever been entertained by him. In default of something better,
therefore, the queen mother endeavored to make capital out of two
passages of these private manuscripts. In one&mdash;it was, we are told, the
will of the admiral, written toward the end of the third civil
war<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>&mdash;he dissuaded Charles from assigning to his brothers appanages
that might diminish the authority of the crown. Catharine triumphantly
showed it to Alençon. "See!" said she; "this is your good friend the
admiral, whom you so greatly loved and respected!" "I know not," replied
the young prince, "how much of a friend he was to me; but certainly he
showed by this advice how much he loved the king."<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> With Walsingham
a similar attempt was made to deprive the murdered hero of Queen
Elizabeth's sympathy, but with as little success. "To the end you may see
how little your mistress was beholden to him," said Catharine de' Medici
one day to the English ambassador, "you may see a discourse found with
his testament, made at such time as he was sick at Rochel, wherein,
amongst other advices that he gave to the king my son, this is one, that
he willed him in any case to keep the queen, your mistress, and the King
of Spain as low as he could, as a thing that tended much to the safety
and maintenance of this crown." "To that I answered," says Walsingham,
"that in this point, howsoever he was affected towards the queen my
mistress, he showed himself a most true and faithful subject to the crown
of France, and the Queen's Majestie, my mistress, made the more account
of him, for that she knew him faithfully affected to the same."<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

and, on the other hand, the clear evidence that Coligny sought for the
quiet and growth of the religious community to which he belonged, only in
connection with the honor and prosperity of his own country, did not
deter the pliant parliament from pursuing the course prescribed for it. A
little more than two months after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day
(October the twenty-seventh, 1572), the admiral's sentence was formally
pronounced. He was proclaimed a traitor and the author of a conspiracy
against the king; his goods were confiscated, his memory declared
infamous. His children were degraded from their rank as nobles, and
pronounced "ignoble, villains, <i>roturiers</i>, infamous, unworthy, and
incapable of making a will, or of holding offices, dignities or
possessions in France." It was ordered that his castle of
Châtillon-sur-Loing should be razed to the ground, never to be rebuilt,
and that the site should be sown with salt; that the trees of the park
should be cut down to half their height, and a monumental pillar be
erected on the spot, with a copy of this decree inscribed upon it. His
portraits and statues were to be destroyed; his arms, wherever found, to
be dragged at the horse's tail and publicly destroyed by the hangman; his
body&mdash;if any fragments could be obtained, or, if not, his effigy&mdash;was to
be dragged on a hurdle, and hung first on the Grève and then on a loftier
gibbet at Montfaucon. Finally, public prayers and a solemn procession
were ordered to take place in Paris on every successive anniversary of
the feast of St. Bartholomew.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the memory of one of the noblest characters that illustrated the
sixteenth century pursued with envenomed hatred, after death had placed
Coligny himself beyond the power of the murderous queen mother to inflict
more substantial injury upon him. To his mortal remains all that malice
could do had already been done. What remained of a mutilated body had
been taken from the hands of those precocious criminals, the boys of
Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span> and hung up by the feet upon the gallows at Montfaucon.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> A

<div class="sidenote">A jubilee procession.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles declares that he will maintain his edict.</div>

<p>Not content with the public admission of his responsibility for the
massacre which he had made before the parliament, Charles with his court
participated two days later (Thursday, the twenty-eighth of August) in
the celebration of a jubilee, and walked in a procession through the
streets of Paris; at successive "stations" rendering thanks to Heaven,
with fair show of devotion, for the preservation of his own life, and the
lives of his brothers and of <i>the King of Navarre</i>. It would have served
greatly to give a color of plausibility to the report of the conspiracy
of the Huguenots, could Navarre and Condé have been prevailed upon to
appear in the king's company on this occasion. But it must be mentioned
to their honor, that they were proof against the persuasions as well as
the threats of Charles.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> The same day a royal declaration was
published, reiterating the allegations made in the Palais de Justice, but
protesting that the king was determined to maintain his edict of
pacification. As, however, the Protestants were forbidden for the present
from holding any public or private assemblies for worship, it must be
admitted that they were not far wrong in regarding the declaration as
only another part of the trap cunningly devised for their
destruction.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Forced conversion of Navarre and Condé.</div>

<p>Although the conversion of the young King of Navarre and his cousin, the
Prince of Condé, did not occur until some weeks later, it may be
appropriately mentioned here. No means were left untried to gain them
over to the Roman Catholic religion. The sophistries of monks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span> were
supplemented by the more dangerous persuasions of a renegade Protestant
minister, Hugues Sureau du Rosier, formerly one of the pastors of the
church of Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Whatever excuse his arguments may have furnished
by covering their renunciation of their faith with the decent cloak of
conviction, <i>fear</i> was certainly the chief instrument in effecting the
desired change in the Huguenot princes. There is no room for doubt that
the character of Charles underwent a marked change, as we shall see
later, from the time that he consented to the massacre. He became more
sullen, more violent, more impatient of contradiction or opposition. It
is not at all unlikely that a mind never fully under control of reason,
and now assuredly thrown from its poise by a desperation engendered of
remorse for the fearful crime he had reluctantly approved, at times
formed the resolution to kill the obstinate King of Navarre and his
cousin. On one occasion Charles is said to have been deterred by the
supplications of his young wife from going in person to destroy
them.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> At length, when the alternative of death or the Bastile was
the only one presented, the courage of the Bourbons began to falter.
Navarre was the first to yield, and his sister, the excellent Catharine
de Bourbon, followed his example. On the thirteenth of September the
ambassador Walsingham wrote: "They prepare Bastile for some persons of
quality. It is thought that it is for the Prince of Condé and his
brethren."<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> But three days later (the sixteenth of September) he
wrote again: "On Sunday last, which was the fourteenth of this month, the
young Princess of Condé was constrained to go to mass, being threatened
otherwise to go to prison, and so consequently to be made away. The
Prince of Condé hath also yielded to hear mass upon Sunday next, being
otherwise threatened to go to the Bastile, where he is not like long to
serve."<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> Such conversions did not promise to prove very sincere.
They were accepted, however, by the king and his mother; although both
Navarre and Condé were detained at court rather as prisoners than as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
free princes. Pope Gregory the Thirteenth received the submission of both
cousins to the authority of the See of Rome, recognized the validity of
their marriages, and formally admitted them to his favor, by a special
bull of the twenty-seventh of October, 1572.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> In return for these
concessions Henry of Navarre repealed the ordinances which his mother had
made for the government of Béarn, and re-established the Roman Catholic
worship.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

Gascon's character, that, having come to Paris some days before, in order
to obtain a commission to command a company of soldiers which he had
raised for the war in Flanders, he had been obliged to leave almost
instantly upon his arrival, because he had acted as the second of a
friend in a duel, and wounded in the face an archer who endeavored to
arrest him. Tavannes makes Coligny suggest the removal of the ensigns
taken from the Protestants as "marques de troubles," and playfully claim
for himself the 50,000 crowns promised to any one who should bring the
admiral's head. Mémoires, éd. Petitot, iii. 293.</p></div>

diversions with which the French court occupied itself on the eve of the
massacre. The connection between reckless merriment and cold-blooded
cruelty is often startlingly close. Besides this, the finances of the
country were so hopelessly involved, as the consequence of the late civil
wars, that this lavish expenditure was particularly ill-timed. If old
Gaspard de Tavannes was as blunt as his son represents him to have been,
he gave Charles some good, but, like most good, unheeded advice. "Sire,"
said he, à propos of the extravagance of the court at Guise's marriage in
1570, "you should make a feast, and instead of the singers who are
brought in artificial clouds, you should bring those who would tell you
this truth: 'You are dolts! You spend your money in festivals, in pomps
and masks, and do not pay your men-at-arms nor your soldiers; foreigners
will beat you!'" Mémoires, éd. Petitot, iii. 183.</p></div>

which agrees substantially with, and was probably derived from, the
version given in Hotman's Gasparis Colinii Vita (1575), 106, 107. On
comparing it, however, with the transcript of the original autograph in
the remarkable collection of the late Col. Henri Tronchin, given by M.
Jules Bonnet in the Bulletin de la Soc. de l'hist. du prot. français, i.
(1853), 369, I discover extraordinary discrepancies, and find that, in
addition to a different phraseology in every sentence, one clause is
inserted by Hotman of which there is not a trace in the Tronchin MS. I
refer to the words: "Soyez asseurée de ma part que, parmi ces festins et
passe-temps, <i>je ne donneray fascherie à personne</i>"&mdash;which would, of
course, point to the prevailing fears of a collision between the admiral
and the young Duke of Guise, or his retainers, whose hatred of Coligny
was so well known that Charles IX. had issued a special injunction to the
parties to keep the peace. The letter contains at the commencement of the
postscript a playful allusion to the hope of his wife soon to be a
mother.</p></div>

Protestants were obliged to go in order to enjoy any religious
privileges, and what fatigue they willingly underwent in order to avail
themselves of them. In 1563, immediately after the close of the first
civil war, instead of being assigned a place for worship in the suburbs,
according to the terms of the edict, the Protestants of Troyes were told
to go to Céant-en-Othe&mdash;full <i>eight leagues</i>, or about <i>twenty-four
miles</i>; nor could they obtain justice by any remonstrances with the
court! As they went to Céant, in spite of its inconvenient distance, and
of the death of several children taken thither to be baptized, the
Romanists, in 1570, actually proposed to remove the Protestant <i>prêche</i>
still farther off, to Villenauxe, <i>thirteen leagues from Troyes!</i>

"Stratagema" of Capilupi, which pretends (ed. of 1574, p. 26) that
<i>Charles</i> placed Maurevel in the house from which he shot at Coligny, on
discovering that the admiral had formed the plan of firing Paris the next
night. To believe these champions of orthodoxy, the Huguenots were born
with a special passion for incendiary exploits. It does not seem to
strike them that burning and pillaging Paris would not be likely to
appear to Coligny a probable means of furthering the war in Flanders.
Besides, what need is there of any such Huguenot plot, even according to
Capilupi's own view, since he carries back the premeditation of the
massacre on the part of Charles at least four years?</p></div>

customary to interpret this language and similar expressions as covertly
referring to the massacre which was then four days off. But this seems
absurd. Certainly, if Charles was privy to the plan for Coligny's murder,
he must have expected him to be killed on Friday&mdash;that is, within less
than two days. If so, what peculiar significance in the <i>four</i> days? For,
if a general massacre had been at first contemplated, no interval of two
days would have been allowed. Everybody must have known that if the
arquebuse shot had done its work, and Coligny had been killed on the
spot, every Huguenot would have been far from the walls of Paris long
before Sunday. As it was, it was only the admiral's confidence, and the
impossibility of moving him with safety, that detained them.</p></div>

fifteen gentlemen in Coligny's suite&mdash;"entre lesquels j'estoy" (p. 174).

was shot. In the sixteenth century the street bore the former name,

appears to have lodged. In later times the name was confined to the part
east of Rue de Roule. Dulaure, Histoire de Paris, iv. 259. The extension

Their eldest brother, Marshal Francis de Montmorency, whose greatest vice
was his sluggishness and his devotion to his ease, had left Paris a few
days before, on the pretext of going to the chase. His absence at the
time of the massacre was supposed to have saved not only his life, but
that of his brothers. The Guises would gladly have destroyed a family
whose influence and superior antiquity had for a generation been
obnoxious to their ambitious designs; but it was too hazardous to leave

strongly, for he tries to reconcile it, but succeeds only poorly.
According to him, it was either a ruse to throw Charles IX. off his guard
by a pretence of confidence in his good faith, or an act of consummate
folly. Any way, great thanks are due to Heaven! "Et sia stato fatto
questo da lui, ò con arte, per dimostrar di non dubitare della fede del

which are contained in the collection of Petitot, etc. It is the only
military treatise we possess coming from the admiral's hand, and it
enters into the subject with technical minuteness. The destruction by his
royal murderers of the admiral's papers (including diaries that would
have thrown great light upon the transactions of the last two years of
his life), see Vita Gasparis Colinii (1575), i. 138, was an irretrievable
loss to history. We are told also of a much more recent act of vandalism,
not even palliated by the miserable excuse of political expediency: "In
1810, an inhabitant of Châtillon having discovered in the solitary
remaining tower of the old castle a walled chamber wherein were the
archives of the Coligny family and of the family of Luxemburg, burned all
the papers from motives of private interest. Some fragments that escaped
this conflagration, and which are preserved in the mairie, prove that a
correspondence between Catharine de' Medici and Coligny had been laid
away in this repository." Bulletin de la Société de l'histoire du prot.

<i>both</i> bells were rung. So also Agrippa d'Aubigné, ii. 16 (liv. i., c.
4), after mentioning how Catharine, for the time being, removed Charles's
hesitation by alleging the necessity of cutting off the corrupt members
in order to save the Church, the Bride of Christ, and citing the saying:
"Che pietà lor ser crudele. Che crudeltà lor ser pietosa," adds: "Le roi
se resout, et elle avance le tocsain du Palais, en faisant sonner <i>une
heure et demie</i> devant celui de Sainct Germain de l'Auxerrois." By
neglecting the clue thus given, the chronological order of the events of
the day has been lost by a number of historians. It will be noticed that
the number of the royal guards reported to have been slain was, strangely
enough, derived from that of the Huguenot gentlemen butchered in the
Louvre by those very guards. The story may have been perpetuated by
misapprehension of the facts; it could have arisen only from wilful
falsehood.</p></div>

of the story are given, with variations, by different authors. D'Aubigné
gives us Biron's answer to the commands and menaces with which Madame de
la Châtaigneraie sought to gain possession of young La Force: "I would
certainly intrust him in the hands of his relative, in order to take care
of him, but not in the hands of his next heir, who took too great care of
him yesterday morning," ii. 21. It must be noted, however, that the
"Mémoires authentiques de Jacques Nompar de Caumont, Duc de la Force,
Maréchal de France, recueillis par le Marquis de la Grange" (Paris,
1843), i. 2-37, so far from accusing the sister of La Force, ascribe the
persistent attempts to secure his death solely to Archan (or Larchant),
who had <i>married</i> this sister; and they state that, at her death, she
left her property, including what she had inherited from her husband, to
her brother.</p></div>

emulated the example of those of Paris. In Provins, in the month of
October, 1572, a Huguenot, Jean Crespin, after having been hung by the
officers of justice, was taken down from the gallows by "les petis enfans
de Provins, <i>de l'âge de douze ans et au dessoubz</i>," to the number of
more than one hundred. By these mimic judges he was declared unworthy to
be dragged save by his feet, and, his punishment by hanging being
reckoned too light, he was roasted in a fire of straw, and presently
thrown into the river. Numbers of older persons looked on, approving and
encouraging the children; a few good Catholics were grieved to see such
cruelty practised on a dead body. Mém. de Claude Haton, ii. 704-706.</p></div>

has been of late the subject of much discussion. M. Fournier and M. Méry
have denied the existence, in 1572, of the pavilion at which tradition
makes the king to have stationed himself. See Bulletin de la Soc. de
l'hist. du prot. français, v. (1857) 332, etc. It has, I think, been
conclusively shown that they are mistaken. The pavilion <i>was</i> in
existence. But, besides, there is no reason why an incident should be
deemed apocryphal because of a popular mistake in assigning the spot of
its occurrence. The "Reveille-Matin" and the Eusebii Philadelphi Dialogi,
published in 1574, are the earliest documents that refer to it. They
place Charles at the window of his own room. So does Brantôme, writing
considerably later. Jean de Serres (in the fourth vol. of his Commentaria
de statu, etc. (fol. 37), published in 1575) says: "Regem quoque ex
hypæthrio (<i>i.e.</i>, from a covered gallery) aiunt, adhibitis, ut solebat,
diris contenta voce conclamare, et tormento etiam ipsum ejaculari."
Agrippa d'Aubigné alludes to it not only in his Histoire universelle (ii.
19, 21), but in his Tragiques (Bulletin, vii. 185), a poem which he
commenced as early as in 1577 (See Bulletin, x. 202). M. Henri Bordier
has been so fortunate as to discover and has reprinted a contemporary
engraving of the massacre, in which Charles is represented as excitedly
looking on the slaughter from a window in the Louvre, while behind him
stand two halberdiers and several noblemen (Bulletin, x. 106, 107). The
question is discussed in an able and exhaustive manner by MM. Fournier,
Ludovic Lalanne, Bernard, Berty, Bordier, and others, in the Bulletin, v.
332-340; vi. 118-126; vii. 182-187; x. 5-11, 105-107, 199-204.</p></div>

the west on the southern side of the Seine. During the reign of Francis
I. and his successors of the house of Valois, the walls of Paris were of
small compass. In this quarter their general direction is well marked out
by the Rue Mazarine. The circuit started from the Tour de Nesle, which
was nearly opposite the eastern front of the Louvre&mdash;the short Rue de
Bussy fixes the situation of the gate where Guise was delayed. A little
west of this is the abbey church of St. Germain-des-Prés, which gave its
name to the suburb opposite the Louvre and the Tuileries. This quaint
pile&mdash;the oldest church, or, indeed, edifice of any kind in Paris&mdash;after
being built in the sixth century, and injured by the Normans in the
ninth, was rebuilt and dedicated in 1163 A.D., by Alexander III. in
person. On that occasion the Bishop of Paris was not even permitted by
the jealous monks to be present, on the ground that the abbey of St.
Germain-des-Prés was exempt from his jurisdiction. The pontiff confirmed
their position, and his sermon, instead of being an exposition of the
Gospel, was devoted to setting forth the privileges accorded to the abbey
by St. Germain, Bishop of Paris, in 886. Dulaure, Histoire de Paris, ii.

thus passed into the hands of the family of Marshal Retz&mdash;the Gondi
family&mdash;was an old castle situated in the midst of an almost unbroken
forest. The Gondi family sold it to Louis XIII., who built a hunting
lodge, afterward transmuted by Louis XIV. into the magnificent palace,
which, for more than a century, was the favorite residence of the most
splendid court in Europe. The mode in which the title was acquired did
not augur well for the justice or the morality which was to reign there.

tabulated the estimates, nine in number, afforded by twenty-one distinct
authorities. The lowest estimate&mdash;1,000 victims&mdash;is that of the Abbé
Caveyrac, whose undisguised aim was to place the number as low as
possible, so as to palliate the atrocity of the massacre. Being based
apparently upon the number of the <i>names</i> of victims that have been
recorded, it may be dismissed as unworthy of consideration. The highest
estimate, of 10,000, though adopted by such writers as the authors of the
Reveille-Matin and the Mémoires de l'estat de France, is vague or
excessive. The Tocsain and Agrippa d'Aubigné are, perhaps, too moderate
in respectively stating the number as 2,000 and 3,000. On the whole, it
appears to me, the contribution of Paris to the massacre of the Huguenots
may be set down with the greatest probability at between 4,000 and 5,000
persons of all ages and conditions. Von Botzheim, who estimates the total
at 8,000 (F. W. Ebeling, Archivalische Beiträge, p. 120), makes 500 of
these to be women (Ibid., p. 119).</p></div>

his noble history (iv. (liv. liii.) 644), Jacques Auguste de Thou
remarks, with an integrity which cannot swerve even out of consideration
for filial respect: "Ce qu'il y avoit de déplorable, étoit de voir des
personnes respectables par leur piété, leur science, et leur intégrité,
revêtues des premières charges du Royaume, ennemies d'ailleurs de tout
déguisement et de tout artifice, tels que Morvilliers, de Thou, Pibrac,
Montluc et Bellièvre, louer contre leurs sentimens, ou excuser par
complaisance une action qu'ils détestoient dans le c&oelig;ur, sans y être
engagés par aucun motif de crainte ou d'espérance; mais dans la fausse
persuasion où ils étoient que les circonstances présentes et le bien de

the author of the Mémoires de l'estat de France sous Charles IX., who,
after contrasting the honorable conduct of President La Vaquerie, in the
time of Louis XI., with that of Christopher de Thou, adds: "Mais
cestui-ci n'avoit garde de faire le semblable; il prend trop de plaisir à
toute sorte d'injustice pour s'y vouloir opposer." (<i>Ubi supra</i>, pp. 156,
157.) So, also, Euseb. Philad. Dial., i. 50: "Nam quomodo sese injustitiæ
viriliter opponeret, qui ex ea tam uberes fructus colligit?" The Mém. de
l'estat accuse him of having instigated the murder of Rouillard&mdash;a
counsellor of parliament and canon of Notre Dame, and one of a very few
Roman Catholics that were assassinated&mdash;because the latter loved justice,
and had prosecuted one of the first president's friends (p. 148).
According to the historian De Thou, on the other hand (iv. 593),
Rouillard was "homme inquiet, querelleux, et ennemi des officiers des
compagnies de ville."</p></div>

has been well remarked by a writer in the Bulletin de la Soc. de l'hist.
du prot. français (iii. 346) as one of the paradoxes of history, that
Coligny's mangled remains, "after being carefully subjected to the most
ignominious treatment, were saved from the annihilation to which they
appeared to be infallibly condemned, and have been transmitted from place
to place, and from hand to hand, until our own days, and better preserved
for three centuries than many other illustrious corpses carefully laid up
in costly mausoleums!" Marshal Montmorency placed the admiral's body in a
lead coffin in his castle of Chantilly, whence he sent it to Montauban.
François de Coligny brought it back to Châtillon-sur-Loing, when, in
1599, the sentence of parliament was formally rescinded. In 1786 it was
taken to Maupertuis and placed in a black marble sarcophagus. Since 1851
it has been resting in its new tomb under the ruins of that part of the
castle of Châtillon where Coligny was probably born. Bulletin, iii.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class='center'><a name="MASSACRE2" id="MASSACRE2"></a>THE MASSACRE IN THE PROVINCES, AND THE RECEPTION OF THE TIDINGS ABROAD.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The massacre in the provinces.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
The massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day would have been terrible enough had
it been confined to Paris, for its victims in that single city were to be
reckoned by thousands. Charles the Ninth himself, on the third day,
admitted in a letter to Mondoucet, his envoy in the Netherlands, that "a
very great number of the adherents of the new religion who were in this
city had been massacred and cut to pieces."<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> But this was little in
comparison with the multitudes that were yet to lose their lives in other
parts of France. Here, however, the enterprise assumed a different
character. Not only did it not commence on the same day as in the
capital, but it began at different dates in different places. It is
evident that there had been no well-concerted plan long entertained and
freely communicated to the governors of the provinces and cities. On the
contrary, the greatest variety of procedure prevailed&mdash;all tending,
nevertheless, to the same end of the total destruction of the
Protestants. And this was intended from the very moment the project of
the Parisian butchery was hastily and inconsiderately adopted by the
king. Charles meant to be as good as his word when he announced his
determination that not a single Huguenot should survive to reproach him
with what he had done. More frightful than his most passionate outburst
of bloodthirsty frenzy is the cool calculation with which he, or the
minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span> who wrote the words he subscribed, predicts the chain of
successive murders in provincial France, scarcely one of which had as yet
been attempted. "<i>It is probable</i>," he said, in the same letter of the
twenty-sixth of August, that has just been cited, "<i>that the fire thus
kindled will go coursing through all the cities of my kingdom</i>, which,
following the example of what has been done in this city, will assure
themselves of all the adherents of the said religion."<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Verbal orders.</div>

<p>No mere surmise, founded upon the probable effects of the exhibition of
cruelty in Paris, led to the penning of this sentence. Charles had
purposely fired the train which was to explode with the utmost violence
at almost every point of his wide dominions. "As it has pleased God," he
wrote to Mondoucet, "to bring matters to the state in which they now are,
I do not intend to neglect the opportunity not only to re-establish, if I
shall be able, lasting quietness in my kingdom, but also to serve
Christendom."<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> Accordingly, secret orders, for the most part verbal,
had already been sent in all directions, commanding the provinces to
imitate the example set by Paris. The reality of these orders does not
rest upon conjecture, but is attested by documentary evidence over the
king's own hand. As we have seen in the last chapter, Charles published,
on the twenty-eighth of August, a declaration of his motives and
intentions. This was despatched to the governors of the provinces and to
other high officers, in company with a circular letter, of which the
final sentence deserves particular notice. "Moreover," says the king,
"whatever verbal command I may have given to those whom I sent to you, as
well as to my other governors and lieutenants-general, at a time when I
had just reason to fear some inauspicious events, from having discovered
the conspiracy which the admiral was making against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span> me, I have revoked
and revoke it completely, intending that nothing therein contained be put
into execution by you or by others; for such is my pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Instructions to Montsoreau at Saumur.</div>

<p>What was the import of these orders? The manuscripts in the archives of
Angers seem to leave no room for doubt. This city was the capital of the
Duchy of Anjou, given in appanage to Henry, the king's brother, and was,
consequently, under his special government. On Tuesday, the twenty-sixth
of August, the duke sent to the Governor of Saumur a short note running
thus: "Monsieur de Montsoreau, I have instructed the sieur de Puigaillard
to write to you respecting a matter that concerns the service of the
king, my lord and brother, as well as my own. You will, therefore, not
fail to believe and to do whatever he may tell you, just as if it were I
myself." In the same package with these credentials Montsoreau<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>
received a letter from Puigaillard, like himself a knight of the royal
order of St. Michael, which reveals only too clearly the purpose of the
king and his Brother. "Monsieur mon compagnon, I will not fail to
acquaint you with the fact that, on Sunday morning the king caused a very
great execution to be made against the Huguenots; so much so that the
admiral and all the Huguenots that were in this city were killed. And his
Majesty's will is that the same be done wherever there are any to be
found. Accordingly, if you desire ever to do a service that may be
agreeable to the king and to Monsieur (the Duke of Anjou), you must go to
Saumur with the greatest possible number of your friends, and put to
death all that you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span> find there of the principal Huguenots.... Having
made this execution at Saumur, I beg you to go to Angers and do the same,
with the assistance of the captain of the castle. And you must not expect
to receive any other command from the king, nor from Monseigneur, for
they will send you none, inasmuch as they depend upon what I write you.
You must use diligence in this affair, and lose as little time as
possible. I am very sorry that I cannot be there to help you in putting
this into execution."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two kinds of letters.</div>

<p>The statement of the author of the Mémoires de l'estat de France is,
therefore, in full agreement with the ascertained facts of the case. He
informs us that, soon after the Parisian massacre commenced, the secret
council by which the plan had been drawn up despatched two widely
differing kinds of letters. The first were of a private character, and
were addressed to governors of cities and to seditious Roman Catholics
where there were many Protestants, by which they were instigated to
murder and rapine;<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> the others were public, and were addressed to
the same functionaries, their object being to amuse and entrap the
professors of the reformed faith. And in addition to the double sets of
written instructions, the same author says that messengers were sent to
various points, to give orders for special executions.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> We shall not
find it very difficult to account for the rapidity with which the
mas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>sacre spread to the provincial towns&mdash;of which the secretary of the
Spanish ambassador, in his hurried journey from Paris to Madrid, was an
eye-witness<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a>&mdash;if we bear in mind the previous ripeness of the lowest
classes of the Roman Catholic population for the perpetration of any
possible acts of insult and injury toward their Protestant
fellow-citizens. The time had come for the seed sown broadcast by monk
and priest in Lenten and Advent discourses to bear its legitimate harvest
in the pitiless murder of heretics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The massacre at Meaux.</div>

<p>Meaux was naturally one of the first of smaller cities to catch the
contagion from the capital. Not only was it the nearest city that
contained any considerable body of Huguenots, but, if we may credit the
report current among them, Catharine, in virtue of her rank as Countess
of Meaux, had placed it first upon the roll. It is not impossible that
the circumstance that this was the cradle of Protestantism in France may
have secured it this distinction. About the middle of Sunday afternoon a
courier reached Meaux, and at once made his way to the residence of the
procureur-du-roi, one Cosset. The nature of the message he bore may be
inferred from the fact that secret orders were at once given to those
persons upon whom Cosset thought that he could rely, to be in readiness
about nightfall. So completely had every outlet from Paris been sealed,
that it had proved almost impossible for a Protestant to find the means
of escaping to carry the tidings abroad. Consequently the adherents of
the reformed faith were yet in ignorance of the impending catastrophe. At
the time appointed, Cosset and his followers seized the gates of Meaux.
It was the hour when the peaceable and unsuspecting people were at
supper. The Protestants could now easily be found, and few escaped
arrest, either that evening or on the succeeding day. Happily, however, a
large number of Huguenots resided in a quarter of Meaux known as the
"Grand Marché," and separated from the main part of the town by the river
Marne. The inhabitants of the Grand Marché received timely warning of
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span> danger; and the men fled by night for temporary refuge to the
neighboring villages. It was scarcely dawn on Monday morning when the
work of plunder begun. By eight o'clock little was left of the goods of
the Huguenots on this side of the Marne, and the pillagers crossed the
bridge to the Grand Marché. Finding only the women, who had remained in
the vain hope of saving their family possessions, the papists wreaked
their fury upon them. About twenty-five of these unhappy persons were
murdered in cold blood;<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> others were so severely beaten that they
died within a few days; a few were shamefully dishonored. In most cases,
if not in all, outward acquiescence in the ceremonies of the Roman
Catholic Church would have saved the lives of the victims, but the
Huguenot women were constant and would yield no hypocritical consent. One
poor woman, the wife of "Nicholas the cap-maker," was being dragged to
mass, when her bold and impolitic expressions of detestation of the
service so enraged her conductors, that, being at that moment upon the
bridge which unites the two portions of the city, they stabbed her and
threw her body into the river. In a short time the Grand Marché, which
the precise chronicler tells us contained more than four hundred houses,
was robbed of everything which could be removed, for not the most
insignificant article escaped the cupidity of the Roman Catholic
populace.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>These were but the preliminaries of the general massacre. The prisons
were full of Huguenots, whom it was necessary to put out of the way. Late
in the day, on Tuesday the twenty-sixth, Cosset and his band made their
appearance. They were provided with a list of their destined victims,
more than two hundred in number. Of a score or two the names have been
preserved, with their respective avocations. They were merchants,
judicial officers, industrious artisans&mdash;in short, the representatives of
the better class of the population of Meaux. Not one escaped. The
murderous band were stationed in the courtyard of the prison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span> while
Cosset, armed with a pistol in either hand, mounted the steps, and by his
roll summoned the Protestants to the slaughter awaiting them below. The
bloody work was long and tedious. The assassins adjourned awhile for
their supper, and, unable to complete the task before weariness blunted
the edge of their ferocity, reserved a part of the Protestants for the
next day. None the less was the task accomplished with thoroughness, and
the exultant cutthroats now had leisure to pursue the fugitives of the
Grand Marché to the villages in which they had taken refuge.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The massacre at Troyes.</div>

<p>The news of the Parisian massacre reached Troyes, the flourishing capital
of Champagne, on Tuesday, the twenty-sixth of August, and spread great
alarm among the Protestants, who, with the recent disturbances<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>
still fresh in their memories, apprehended immediate death. But their
enemies for the time confined themselves to closing the gates to prevent
their escape. It was not until Saturday, the thirtieth, that the
"bailli," Anne de Vaudrey, sieur de St. Phalle, sent throughout the city
and brought all the Protestants to the prisons. Meantime one of the most
turbulent of the Roman Catholics, named Pierre Belin, had been in Paris,
having been deputed, some weeks before, to endeavor to procure the
removal of the place of worship of the reformed from the castle of
Isle-au-Mont, two or three leagues from the city, to some more distant
and inconvenient spot. He remained in the capital until the Saturday
after the massacre, and started that day for Troyes, with a copy of the
declaration of Thursday forbidding injury to the persons and goods of
unoffending Protestants, and ordering the release of any that might have
been imprisoned. It was believed, indeed, that he was commissioned to
give the declaration to the bailli for publication. On Wednesday, the
third of September, he reached Troyes. As he rode through the streets, he
inquired again and again whether the Huguenots at Troyes were all killed
as they were elsewhere. When interrogated by peaceable Roman Catholics
respecting a rumor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span> that the king had revoked his sanguinary orders, he
boldly denied its truth, accompanying his words with oaths and
imprecations. Finding the bailli, he had no difficulty in persuading him
to suppress the royal order, and to convene a council, at which Belin was
introduced as the bearer of verbal instructions, and a bishop was brought
forward to confirm them. Belin and the bishop maintained that the royal
pleasure was that the heretics of Troyes should all be murdered on the
following Saturday night, without distinction of rank, sex, or age, and
their bodies be exposed in the streets to the sight of those who should
on the morrow join in a solemn procession to be held in honor of the
achievement. A writing attached to the neck of each was to contain the
words: "Seditious persons and rebels against the king, who have conspired
against his Majesty."</p>

<p>The task of butchering the helpless Huguenots in the prison was first
proposed to the public hangman. He refused to take any part in it: this,
he said, was no duty of his office, and he would consent to perform it
only when all the forms of law should have been observed. Other persons
were found more pliable, and, under the leadership of one Perremet, the
bloody scenes of the prison of Meaux were re-enacted, on Thursday, the
fourth day of September, in that of Troyes. How many were the victims we
know not; we have, however, the names of over thirty, apparently the most
prominent of the number. Others were assassinated in the streets. At
last, when all had been done that malice could effect, the king's
declaration, which promised protection to the Huguenots, was published on
Friday, the fifth of September.<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The great bloodshed at Orleans.</div>

<p>In Orleans, a city once the headquarters of the Huguenots, where their
iconoclastic assaults upon the churches during the first civil war had
left permanent memorials of their former supremacy, the massacre assumed
the largest proportions. One of the king's court preachers, Arnauld
Sorbin, better known as M. de Sainte Foy, had written from Paris letters
instigating the inhabitants of Orleans to imi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>tate the example of the
capital, and the letters came to hand with the earliest tidings of the
Parisian massacre. The first murder took place on Monday. M. de
Champeaux, a royal counsellor and a Protestant, who as yet was in
ignorance of the events of St. Bartholomew's Day, received late on Monday
the visit of Tessier, surnamed La Court, the leader of the assassins of
Orleans, and some of his followers. Imagining it to be a friendly
call&mdash;for they were acquaintances&mdash;Champeaux received them courteously,
and invited them to sup with him. The meal over, his guests recounted the
story of the tragic occurrence at Paris, and, before he was well over his
surprise and horror, asked him for his purse. The unhappy host, still
mistaking the character of those whom he had entertained, at first
regarded the demand as a pleasantry; but when he had been convinced of
his error and had complied, his treacherous visitors instantly stabbed
him to death in his very dining-room.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> The general butchery began on
Tuesday night, in the neighborhood of the ramparts, where the Protestants
were most numerous, and from Wednesday to Saturday there was no
intermission in the slaughter. Here, more even than elsewhere, the
murderers distinguished themselves by their profanity and their
undisguised hatred of the Protestant faith and worship. "Where is your
God?" "Where are your prayers and your psalms?" "Where is the God they
invoke so much? Let Him save, if He can." Such were the expressions with
which the blows of the assassin were interlarded. At times he thought to
aggravate his victim's sufferings by singing snatches of favorite psalms
from the Huguenot psalm-book. It might be the forty-third, so appropriate
to the condition of oppressed innocence, in its quaint old French garb:</p>

<p>"These execrable outrages," adds the chronicler who gives us this
interesting information, "did not in the least unnerve the Protestants,
who died with great constancy; and, if some were shaken (as were some,
but in very small numbers), this in no wise lessened the patience and
endurance of the rest."<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> The number of the killed was great. The
murderers themselves boasted of the slaughter of more than twelve hundred
men and of one hundred and fifty women, besides a large number of
children of nine years old and under. And there was a dreary uniformity
in the method of their death. They were shot with pistols, then stripped,
and dragged to the river, or thrown into the city moat.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> But it is,
after all, not the numbers of nameless victims whose honorable deaths
leave no distinct impression upon the mind, but the individual instances
of Christian heroism, teaching lessons of imitable human virtues, that
speak most directly to the sympathies of the reader of an age so long
posterior. The records of French Protestantism are full of these, and one
or two of the most striking that occurred in Orleans deserve mention. M.
de Coudray&mdash;whom the Roman Catholics had in vain endeavored on previous
occasions to shake&mdash;seeing his house beset and no prospect of
deliverance, himself opened the door of his dwelling to the murderers,
telling them, with wonderful assurance of faith: "You do but hasten the
coming of that blessedness which I have long been expecting."<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
Whereupon they killed him, in the midst of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span> invocation of his God.
Another Huguenot, De St. Thomas, a schoolmaster, died uttering words as
courageous as ever fell from lips of early Christian martyrs: "Why! do
you think that you move me by your blasphemies and acts of cruelty? It is
not within your power to deprive me of the assurance of the grace of my
God. Strike as much as you please; I fear not your blows."<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>
Sometimes the dying men were allowed a few moments to utter a final
prayer; but, if their zeal led them too far, their impatient murderers
cut short their devotions with oaths and curses, and exclaimed: "Here are
people that take a great while to pray to their God!"<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> Of resistance
there was little, so far were the Huguenots from having collected arms
and prepared for such a conspiracy as was imputed to them. If a Huguenot
teacher of fencing killed one or two of his assailants, or if a few
gentlemen at different places kept them at bay awhile with stones or
other missiles, this, so far from proving their evil intentions, on the
contrary, furnishes undeniable proof of the very different results that
might have ensued had their means of defence been equal to their courage.
For fifteen days after the principal massacre the work went on more
quietly, the dead bodies being still thrown into the ditch&mdash;where wolves,
which in the sixteenth century abounded in the valley of the Loire, were
permitted to feed upon them undisturbed&mdash;or into the river, of whose
fish, fattened upon this human carrion, the people feared to eat.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Massacre at Bourges.</div>

<p>At Bourges the news of the massacre was received late on Tuesday.
Meantime, some of the more sagacious of the Huguenots (among others, the
celebrated Francis Hotman, at this time a professor of law in the
University of Bourges), alarmed by the wounding of Admiral Coligny, had
fled from the city. Even after the news came, the massacre was but
partial. Although the mayor, Jean Joupitre, had received sealed orders
(lettres de cachet) instructing him as to the part he was to take, the
municipal officers, knowing the ill-will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span> the Guises had always borne to
the Huguenots, were in doubt how far the king countenanced the bloody
work. But the royal letter of the thirtieth of August, accompanying the
declaration of the twenty-eighth, to which reference was made
above,<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> so far from putting an end to the disorder, only rendered it
more general. Bourges became the scene of another of those butcheries of
Huguenots first gathered in the public prisons, of which there are so
many similar instances that it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion
that the orders to effect them emanated from a single source at
court.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">At Angers.</div>

<p>We have already been admitted to the secret of the instructions sent by
the Duke of Anjou, through Puigaillard, to M. de Montsoreau, for the
destruction of the Huguenots of Saumur and Angers. Certainly there was on
his part no lack of readiness to fulfil his sanguinary commission; but
the local officers were less zealous, and many of the Protestants were
merely thrown into prison. Montsoreau's first exploit at Angers deserves
particular mention. M. de la Rivière, the first reformed pastor of Paris,
of whom I have spoken in a previous chapter, was at this time residing in
Angers, and Montsoreau seems to have been acquainted with him. Going
straight to his house, the governor met the pastor's wife, whom,
according to the gallant custom prevailing, especially among the Trench
courtiers, he first kissed, and then inquired for her husband. He was
told that he was walking in his garden, and thither his hostess led him.
After courteously embracing him, Montsoreau thus abruptly disclosed the
object of his visit: "Monsieur de la Rivière, do you know why I am come?
The king has ordered me to kill you, and that at once. I have a special
commission to this effect, as you will know from these letters." While
saying this he exhibited a pistol which he held in his hand. "I know of
no crime that I have done," calmly replied De la Rivière; and then, after
obtaining permission to offer a brief prayer to God, he fearlessly
presented his breast to the cowardly assassin. Montsoreau did not
complete the extermination of the Huguenots of Angers, and Pui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>gaillard
soon after arrived to prosecute it; but the Protestant prisoners whom he
was to have murdered knew his venal disposition, and found little
difficulty in purchasing their liberation.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Butchery at Lyons.</div>

<p>The important city of Lyons, inhabited by a population intensely hostile
to the Reformation, had for its governor M. de Mandelot, a decided
partisan of the Roman Catholic faction. The municipal authorities,
however, either surpassed him in zeal, or, as is more probable, were less
apprehensive of the dangers to be incurred by assuming the responsibility
of a massacre; for of all the "échevins," only two opposed the violent
measures of their associates. The written protest which they insisted
upon entering on the official records is still extant.<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> The first
tidings of the wounding of Coligny by Maurevel reached Lyons on Wednesday
morning, the twenty-seventh of August, in a letter from Charles the Ninth
to Governor Mandelot, similar in tenor to those which were despatched to
every other part of France.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> Although the king spoke only of
displeasure at the outrage, and of his determination to avenge it, the
populace interpreted the event according to their wishes, and instantly
circulated reports of the murder of the admiral and all his adherents.
The Roman Catholics, long discontented with the toleration extended to
those who dissented from the creed of the dominant church, were jubilant
and menacing; the Protestants were disheartened, but exhibited a
self-control only to be accounted for by the long years of oppression
which had wellnigh broken their spirit. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span> day came the news of
the events of Sunday, and, in the afternoon, letters from Masso and
Rubys, prominent citizens of Lyons then at Paris, who said that they had
been instructed by the king to order the authorities to copy the example
of the capital. The fanatical party was now clamorous; but Mandelot,
cautious and politic, would act on no such instructions, although he had
taken the precaution of closing the gates, and of commanding the
Protestants, on pain of imprisonment, to remain in their houses. Friday
morning came, and with it the arrival of Sieur du Peyrat from court,
bearing the royal letter written on the day of the massacre, in which it
was represented as the exclusive work of the Guises, and the king
strenuously enjoined the maintenance of the Edict of Pacification.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>
These were the <i>public</i> instructions sent to Mandelot; but they were not
all. There is a suspicious little postscript to the letter: "Monsieur de
Mandelot, you will give credit to the bearer respecting the matter which
I have charged him to tell you."<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> What these verbal orders were
which the king, not venturing to commit to paper, commissioned Du Peyrat
to communicate, the reply of the governor himself distinctly reveals; it
was the arrest of the Protestants and the confiscation of their
property.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> Still more perplexed as to what course to pursue,
Mandelot held a long private conference with the messenger, while the
échevins impatiently awaited its conclusion. The governor now called in
the municipal officers for consultation, and with them agreed to order
the immediate imprisonment of the Huguenots. He was not, however, even
yet fully convinced of the propriety of this step, for scarcely had he
given the order when he recalled it.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Fearing that the troops at his
disposal might prove insufficient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span> and dreading with good reason lest
the employment of the city militia for this purpose might lead to scenes
of disorder which he would find himself powerless to control, he
preferred to send for such reinforcements as the neighboring noblemen of
the province could furnish.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> Meantime, the commotion throughout
Lyons had rapidly increased. On Thursday and Friday nights many members
of the Reformed Church had been dragged from their houses as if to
prison, but most of them had been barbarously despatched by the way.
Among others, one of the ministers, Monsieur Jacques l'Anglois, was
stabbed and thrown into the river. On Saturday morning Mandelot, seeing
the confusion hourly increasing, deemed it impolitic to wait any longer
for the troops he was expecting, and resolved upon effecting his purpose
by ruse. He therefore published a proclamation by sound of trumpet,
bidding all the Huguenots to assemble at his house to hear the good
pleasure of the king. The Huguenots, deceived by the professions of his
Majesty, came in great numbers; but no sooner had they all arrived, than
they were seized by the soldiers and hurried away to prison. The common
prison, "La Roanne," being too contracted to contain so large a
multitude, three hundred or more were placed in that of the Archbishop's
palace, and others in the cloisters of the Celestine Monks and the Gray
Friars. At the same time an inventory was being made of all the goods
belonging to Protestants throughout the city.</p>

<p>These measures, instead of allaying, only inflamed the passions of the
populace the more. That night the murders surpassed those of the previous
nights in number and atrocity, and when Sunday morning dawned the people
were ready for still greater excesses. At about eight o'clock they
entered unopposed the Gray Friars, and butchered every Huguenot they
found. Two hours later, assuming the forms of law, a self-constituted
commission, headed by André Mornieu, one of the échevins or aldermen,
presenting themselves successively at the archiepiscopal prison and at
the Roanne, summoned the inmates to abjure their faith and go to mass.
Only thirty persons in the one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span> about twenty in the other,
consented. These were sent to the Celestine monastery and afterward
released. Of the others a careful list was drawn up. Their fate was
sealed; but an unexpected difficulty arose. The public hangman refused to
execute the sentence of an unauthorized tribunal. So did the soldiers. At
last assassins were obtained from the ranks of the turbulent inhabitants.
About three o'clock that afternoon the archbishop's prison was visited.
To describe with minuteness the scene of horror that ensued would
scarcely be possible. Two hundred and sixty-three persons,<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> of the
very best and most industrious part of the population of Lyons,<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
called by name according to the roll previously made, were murdered in
rapid succession. Never was there an exhibition of more pitiless cruelty.
Meanwhile, where was the governor? He had gone, in company with the
commandant of the citadel, to suppress a threatened disturbance in the
Faubourg de la Guillotière, on the left bank of the Rhône. He returned
only in time to find the deed done, and to disperse those who had gone to
the Roanne to repeat it there. His demonstrations of anger were loud, and
a liberal reward was offered for the detection of any that had
participated in the slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> But this did not prevent the same
body of cutthroats from visiting the Roanne, soon after nightfall, and
despatching all the Protestants that were there, to the number of about
seventy. Many of them, by an excess of barbarity, the assassins tied
together by a single rope, and threw, while yet alive, into the water. On
the follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>ing day the bodies which had not yet found a watery grave were
carried to the other side of the Saône, where, stripped and mangled, they
were about to be buried in the cemetery of the Abbaye d'Esnay, when the
monks refused them admission into the consecrated ground, and pointed to
the Rhône as a more fitting destination. Even now they were not spared
further mutilation; for an apothecary of Lyons, having initiated the
murderers into the valuable properties of human fat as a medicinal
substance, the miserable remains were put to new use before being
consigned to the river. Down to the Mediterranean these ghastly witnesses
of the ferocity of the passions of the Lyonnese Roman Catholics carried
fear and disgust, and for weeks the inhabitants of Arles and other places
carefully abstained from drinking the water of the polluted stream.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Responsibility of Mandelot.</div>

<p>The part which Mandelot took in this awful tragedy has been very
differently estimated, but I am inclined to think that the governor is
not chargeable with any direct responsibility for the butchery in the
prisons of Lyons. Certainly this seems to be established by his letter to
the king, written in the morning of the day on which it occurred; for he
would scarcely have expressed his great desire and hope to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span> able to
prevent any outbreak, if he had planned, or even foreseen, the events of
the evening.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> The story must therefore be apocryphal, that Mandelot,
in commissioning one of the chief assassins to execute the bloody work,
blasphemously said: "I intrust the whole to you, and, as Jesus Christ
said to Saint Peter, whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> It was, however, no conscientious scruple that deterred
the governor from actively taking part. Mandelot was scandalously anxious
to obtain his part of the plunder, and was not ashamed to appear as a
suppliant for the confiscated property of the Huguenots almost before
their bodies were cold.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> But he was unwilling, without the express
orders of his sovereign, written with his own hand, to commit an act
which, the more successful it might be, was the more certain to be
disavowed and punished. He was right: a subordinate could not be too
careful in dealing with so treacherous a court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The massacre at Rouen.</div>

<p>Few cities were so ripe for the massacre of the Protestants as the
capital of Normandy. There the passions of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span> Catholics, inflamed
by the civil wars, had not been suffered to cool. Even in the provincial
parliament the papists could hardly submit to receive into their
deliberations again the five or six Huguenot counsellors who had been
expelled or had fled at the outbreak of hostilities, but whom the Edict
of Pacification restored to their ancient functions and dignity; and the
secret registers, among other unfortunate scenes, chronicle particularly
a violent discussion, degenerating into angry altercation between
President Vialard and the Huguenot member Maynet.<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> The bloody
assault of the populace of Rouen upon the reformed in March, 1571,
mentioned in a previous page,<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> had been but slightly punished. Few
of the guilty failed to escape from the city, and the sole penalty
suffered had been an execution in effigy. These turbulent men had ever
since that time been watching an opportunity to return. They were now
burning with a desire to signalize their advent by bloody reprisals.
Monsieur de Carouge, governor of the city, was, however, a just and
upright man,<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> and they could not hope for countenance in their plans
from him. In fact, the contemporary accounts inform us that he received
from the king repeated orders to exterminate the Huguenots of
Rouen,<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> which he could not bring himself to execute, and that he
sent messengers to remonstrate with his Majesty who returned without
succeeding in shaking his determination; and hereupon the governor found
himself obliged to shut himself up in the castle, and permit the work
which had been intrusted to others also, to take its course.<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> The
secret records of parliament, however, reveal the fact that Carouge
received from Paris the order to leave Rouen and visit other portions of
Normandy, in order to restore the quiet and peace which had been much
disturbed of late. The real,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span> though perhaps not the ostensible object of
this commission was to rid the city of the presence of a magistrate whose
well known integrity might render it futile to attempt a massacre of the
innocent. The records also show that, contrary to the current report,
both the municipal authorities and the parliament, greatly alarmed at the
danger menacing Rouen in case of his departure, implored him to
remain;<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> but that the king's peremptory commands left him no
discretion, and he was obliged to leave the unhappy city to its fate. The
able historian of the Norman Parliament has rightly observed that the
governor, whether he left Rouen because he could not consent to execute
the barbarous injunctions that were sent him, or because his character
was so well known that the court was unwilling to intrust them to him, is
equally deserving of praise; and not without reason does this writer
claim similar respect for the judicial body which manifested its desire
to save everything, by retaining him at Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> Here, as elsewhere,
a great part of the Protestants had been arrested and placed in the
prisons, to shield them from popular violence. The governor believed this
to be the safest place for them; and at least one instance is known of a
father who was so convinced of it that he brought thither his Huguenot
son, whom he might have sent out of the city.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

<p>The storm, so long delayed, broke out at last on Wednesday, the
seventeenth of September, and lasted four entire days. The gates were
closed, and the organized bands of murderers, under the leadership of
Laurent de Maromme, one of the most sanguinary of the turbulent men who
had returned from banishment, and of a priest, Claude Montereul, curate
of the church of St. Pierre, had undisputed possession of the city. First
they slaughtered like sheep the prisoners in the spacious "conciergerie"
of the parliament house and in the other prisons of the city. Next they
burst into the houses, and nearly every atrocity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span> which history is
compelled at any time reluctantly to chronicle, was perpetrated on
unresisting men, on tender women, on unoffending children. Not less than
five hundred persons, and perhaps even more, perished in a butchery,
whose details I gladly pass over in silence.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> Grim humor and charity
were incongruously mingled with the most brutal inhumanity. The assassins
jocularly denominated their work one of "accommodating" their
victims;<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> and the clothes of the Protestants&mdash;whose bodies were
buried in great ditches outside of the Porte Cauchoise&mdash;after having been
carefully washed, were piously distributed among the poor.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> The
tragedy finished, the farce of an investigation was instituted by the
officers of justice, but no punishment was ever inflicted upon any Roman
Catholic, other than that which could be recognized in the retributive
judgments befalling a few of the most notable, and especially the cruel
Maromme, at the hand of God.<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">At Toulouse.</div>

<p>The previous character of Toulouse, as among the most sanguinary cities
of France, was already sufficiently well established. If behind some of
the rest on this occasion in the number of victims, Toulouse was inferior
only because its previous massacres had rendered it a suspicious place of
sojourn in the eyes of the Huguenots. Here, too, notwithstanding
deceitful proclamations guaranteeing safety and protection, the
Protestants were gathered into the public prisons and jails attached to
monasteries; and after having been reserved for several weeks, on receipt
of orders from Paris were butchered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span> to the number of two or three
hundred. Among others, some Protestant members of parliament were hung in
their long red gowns to the branches of a great elm growing in the court
of the parliament house.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> The miscreants that voluntarily assumed
the functions of executioners were in this case drawn in great part from
the more unruly class of the law students of the university.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> It is
needless to add that here, as elsewhere, the opportunity for plunder was
by no means neglected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Bordeaux.</div>

<p>The procedure in Bordeaux was so extraordinary, and is so authentically
related in a letter of a prominent judicial officer who was present, as
well as in the records of the Parliament of Guyenne, that the story of
its massacre must be added to the notices already given. At first the
city was quiet, and the friends of order congratulated themselves that
their efforts had been successful in removing the stigma which previous
transactions had affixed to its escutcheon. Meantime this policy, united
to the fear of a fate similar to that which had befallen their
fellow-believers elsewhere, is said to have led to a great number of
conversions to the Roman Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> But there were those who
were unwilling that their prey should so easily escape them. On the fifth
of September, M. de Montferrand, Governor of Bordeaux, affecting to have
information of a general plot on the part of the Huguenots of the city,
had sought and obtained permission of the parliament to introduce three
hundred soldiers from abroad. He had thereupon forbidden the celebration
of Protestant worship, hitherto held at a distance of three leagues from
Bordeaux, on the plain between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span> the Garonne and the Jalle.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> Meantime
the churches resounded with the violent denunciations of a famous
preacher, Friar Edmond Auger or Augier, "a great scourge for heresy," as
his partisans styled him. He exhorted his hearers to imitate the example
of Paris, and accused the royal officers of indolence and pusillanimity.
At this juncture the governor received a visit from Monsieur de
Montpézat, son-in-law of Villars, the newly appointed admiral. What the
latter told him is unknown. But, on the third of October, Montferrand
having given out that he had received from the king a roll of names of
forty of the chief men of the place, whom he was commissioned to put to
death without judge or trial, set about his bloody work. Persistently
refusing to exhibit his warrant, for three days the governor butchered
the citizens at will.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> One member of parliament, against whom he
bore a personal grudge, he stabbed with his own hand. The murderers wore
red bonnets supplied by one of the "jurats" or aldermen of the city. They
executed their commission so thoroughly that the number of the slain was
reported as two hundred and sixty-four persons, all Protestants. If any
one be mercifully inclined to regard this statement as an exaggeration,
and to base upon this instance a general theory that throughout France
the number of the victims has been grossly over-estimated, let him read
the following entry made in the records of the Parliament of Bordeaux,
and recently brought to light; he will learn from this not only the
approximate number of the slain as given by the chief agent in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
bloody work, but the anxiety which the latter felt that he should receive
due credit for his share in the great undertaking of the destruction of
the French Protestants: "On the ninth of October, the Sieur de
Montferrand, having been summoned to the court, among other things said,
'that he had been informed that there were some members of the court who
had written to the Sieur Admiral de Villars, royal lieutenant in Guyenne,
that the said De Montferrand had killed, on the day of the execution by
him made, October the third, only ten or twelve men, a thing (under
correction of the court) wholly false, inasmuch as there had been more
than two hundred and fifty slain; and he would show the list to any one
who might desire to see it.'"<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a></p>

<p>The same hand that placed upon the parliamentary registers this shameless
and atrocious boast, for the benefit of those that should come after, has
briefly noted the assassination of two members of parliament itself, with
an absence of comment in which we can read the evidence of fear. "From
the talk of to-day it appears that Messieurs Jean de Guilloche and Pierre
de Sevyn were killed as belonging to the new religion."<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> The tardy
and flagrantly unnecessary effusion of blood at Bordeaux exercised no
mean influence in emboldening the Huguenots of La Rochelle to persevere
in their refusal to admit the emissaries of Charles the Ninth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why the massacre was not universal.</div>

<p>The massacre was, however, neither universal throughout France, nor
equally destructive in all places where it occurred. The reason for this
is to be found partly in the geographical distribution of the Huguenots,
partly in the temper of the people, partly in the policy or the humanity
of the governors of cities and provinces. Where the number of Protestants
was small, and especially where they had never rendered themselves
formidable, it was not easy for the clergy to excite the people to that
frenzy of sectarian hatred under the influence of which they were willing
to imbrue their hands in the blood of peaceable neighbors. In such
places&mdash;in Provins, for instance&mdash;the Huguenots generally kept themselves
as far as possible out of sight, while a few of the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span> timid consented
to place a white cross on their hats, a convenient badge of Roman
Catholicism which some were willing to assume, when they would rather
have died than go to mass.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Policy of the Guises.</div>

<p>In the province of Champagne the Protestants were spared any general
massacre by the prudent foresight of the Guises, to whom its government
was confided. The duke, in order to free himself from the imputation of
being the author of the bloody plot, and to prove that his private
resentment did not extend beyond Admiral Coligny and a few other chiefs,
had himself taken several Huguenots in Paris under his special
protection. With the same object in view, he made his province an
exception to the widespread slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spurious accounts of clemency.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bishop Le Hennuyer, of Lisieux.</div>

<p>Others, however, were, merciful from more honorable motives. A number of
instances of clemency are mentioned. It is not, indeed, always safe to
accept the stories, some of which are suspicious from their very form,
while others are manifest inventions of an age when tolerance had become
more popular than persecution. To the category of fable we are compelled
to assign the famous response which Le Hennuyer, Bishop of Lisieux, is
reported, by authors writing long after the event, as having returned to
the lieutenant sent to him by Charles the Ninth. History is occasionally
capricious, but she has rarely indulged in a more remarkable freak than
when putting into the mouth of an advocate of persecution, a courtier and
the almoner of the king, who was not even in his diocese, but undoubtedly
in Paris itself, at the time the incident is said to have occurred, this
declamatory speech: "No, no, sir; I oppose, and shall always oppose, the
execution of such an order. I am the shepherd of the church of Lisieux,
and the people I am commanded to slaughter are my flock. Although at
present wanderers, having strayed from the fold intrusted to me by Jesus
Christ the great shepherd, they may, nevertheless, return. I do not read
in the Gospel that the shepherd should suffer the blood of his sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span> to
be shed; on the contrary, I find there that he is bound to pour out his
own blood and give his own life for them. Take the order back, for it
shall never be executed so long as I live."<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Kind offices of Matignon at Caen and Alençon;</div>

<div class="sidenote">of Longueville and Gordes;</div>

<p>Fortunately, there are other instances on record which are not
apocryphal. Monsieur de Matignon seems to have saved Caen and Alençon
from becoming the scenes of general massacres, and thus to have endeared
himself to the Protestants of both places.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> The Duke of Longueville

Gordes, Governor of Dauphiny, who had obtained advancement by the
assistance of the Montmorency influence, excused himself, when repeatedly
urged to kill the Huguenots, on the plea that Montbrun and others of
their leaders were alive and out of his reach, and that any attempt of
the kind would only lead to still greater difficulties. He therefore
waited for more direct instructions. When, in his letter of the fifth of
September, in reference to a clause in the king's letter just received,
he stated that he had received no verbal orders, but merely his letters
of the twenty-second, twenty-fourth, and twenty-eighth of August, Charles
replied bidding him give himself no solicitude as to them, as they were
addressed only to a few persons who hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>pened to be near him,<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> and
enjoined upon him to enforce the royal "declaration," and cause all
murder and rapine to cease in his government. Yet even here a number of
Huguenots were imprisoned, and a few lost their lives at Romans.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">of Tende in Provence.</div>

<p>The manly boldness of the Comte de Tende is said in like manner to have
saved the Protestants of Provence. Receiving from the hands of La Mole, a
gentleman of Arles and servant of the Duke of Alençon, a letter from the
secret council ordering him to massacre all the Huguenots in his
province, the governor replied: "I do not believe that such commands have
emanated from the king's free will; but some of the members of his
council have usurped the royal authority in order to satisfy their own
passions. I need no more conclusive testimony than the letters which his
Majesty sent me a few days ago, by which he threw upon the Guises the
blame for this massacre of Paris. I prefer to obey these first letters,
as more befitting the royal dignity. Besides, this last order is so cruel
and barbarous, that even were the king himself in person to command me to
put it into execution, I would not do it." The magnanimity of the count
spared Provence the horrors of a repetition of the massacres of Mérindol
and Cabrières, but perhaps cost him his own life, for he soon after died
at Avignon, and rumor ascribed his death to poison. The infamous Count de
Retz, Catharine's favorite, succeeded him as governor.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> Saint Héran,
Governor of Auvergne, is said to have replied in very similar words; but
as he managed to induce a great part of the Protestants within his

violent and imperious temper, but on other occasions so severe in his
treatment of the Protestants of the border city, that the king was
obliged to write to him to moderate his rigor. When, however, the
messenger from Paris (who on his way had caused an indiscriminate
slaughter to be made of all the men, women and children who had taken
refuge in the prisons of Dax) delivered his orders to the viscount, the
latter returned the following laconic answer:</p>

good citizens and brave soldiers, but not one hangman. For this reason

<p>Nor were the municipal authorities in some places behind the royal
governors in their determination to have no part in the nefarious designs

Paris, on the eighth of September, a letter of the Duke of
Montpensier-Bourbon, Governor of Brittany, in which, after narrating the
discovery of the pretended conspiracy of Coligny and his adherents, and
their consequent assassination, he added: "By this his Majesty's

be relied upon as expressing the true number of those who were unjustly

has not been removed; notwithstanding the careful investigations of those

<div class="sidenote">News of the massacre received at Rome.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Public thanksgivings.</div>

<p>While the massacre begun on St. Bartholomew's Day was spreading with the
speed of some foul contagion to the most distant parts of France, the
tidings had been carried beyond its boundaries, and excited a thrill of
delight, or a cry of execration, according to the character and
sympathies of those to whom they came. Nowhere was the surprise greater,
nor the joy more intense, than at Rome. Pope Gregory, like his
predecessor, had been very sceptical respecting the pious intentions of
the French court. Nuncios and legates brought them, it is true, a great
profusion of brilliant assurances, on the part of Catharine and Charles,
of devotion to the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span> Church, and to the interests of the Pontifical
See, but accompanied by lugubrious vaticinations of their own, based upon
the tolerant course on which the king, under Coligny's guidance, had
entered. The Cardinal of Alessandria had made little account of the ring
offered him by Charles as a pledge of his sincerity, and preferred to
wait for the proof which the sequel might exhibit. The last defiant act
of the French monarch, in marrying his sister to a professed heretic, and
within the degrees of consanguinity prohibited by the Church, without
obtaining the Pope's dispensation, served to confirm all the sinister
suspicions entertained at Rome. Under these circumstances the papal
astonishment and rejoicing can well be imagined, when couriers sent by
the Guises brought the intelligence of the massacre to the Cardinal of
Lorraine, and when letters from the King of France and from the Nuncio
Salviati in Paris to the Pope himself confirmed its accuracy. Salviati's
letters having been read in the full consistory, on the sixth of
September, the pontiff and the cardinals resolved to go at once in solemn
procession to the church of San Marco, there to render thanks to God for
the signal blessing conferred upon the Roman See and all Christendom. A
solemn mass was appointed for the succeeding Monday, and a jubilee
published for the whole Christian world. In the evening the cannon from
the Castle of San Angelo, and firearms discharged here and there
throughout the city, proclaimed to all the joy felt for so signal a
victory over the enemies of the Church. For three successive nights there
was a general illumination. Cardinal Orsini, who seems to have been on
the point of starting for France as a special legate to urge the court to
withdraw from the course of toleration, now received different
instructions, and was commissioned to congratulate Charles, and to
encourage him to pursue the path upon which he had entered. Charles of
Lorraine, as was natural, distinguished himself for his demonstrations of
joy. He made a present of one thousand crowns to the bearer of such glad
tidings.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> Under his auspices a brilliant celebration of the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
took place in the church of San Luigi de' Francesi, which was
magnificently decorated for the occasion. Gregory himself, attended by
his cardinals and bishops, by princes, foreign ambassadors, and large
numbers of nobles and of the people, walked thither under the pontifical
canopy, and high mass was said. The Cardinal of Lorraine had affixed
above the entrance a pompous declaration, in the form of a congratulatory
notice from Charles the Ninth to Gregory and the "sacred college of
cardinals," wherein the Very Christian King renders thanks to Heaven
that, "inflamed by zeal for the Lord God of Hosts, like a smiting angel
divinely sent, he had suddenly destroyed by a single slaughter almost all
the heretics and enemies of his kingdom." The latinity of the placard
might not be above reproach; but it is certain that its sentiments
received the cordial approval of the assembled prelates.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> Set forth

ribbons,<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> it proclaimed that the hierarchy of the Roman Church had
no qualms of conscience in indorsing the traitorous deed of Charles and
Catharine. But still more unequivocal proofs were not wanting. A well
known medal was struck in honor of the event, bearing on the one side the
head of the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span> and the words "Gregorius XIII. Pont. Max. An. I.," and
on the other an angel with cross and sword pursuing the heretics, and the
superscription, "Ugonottorum strages, 1572."<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Paintings by Vasari in the Vatican.</div>

<p>By the order of the Pope, the famous Vasari painted in the Sala Regia of
the Vatican palace several pictures representing different scenes in the
Parisian massacre. Upon one an inscription was placed which tersely
expressed the true state of the case: "Pontifex Colinii necem
probat."<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> The paintings may still be seen in the magnificent room

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p><p>To the French ambassador, M. de Ferralz, Gregory expressed in the most
extravagant terms his satisfaction, and that of the college of cardinals,
not only with the events of Paris, but with the news daily coming to Rome
of similar massacres in progress in different cities of France. He
convinced Ferralz that no more delightful tidings could have reached the
pontifical court. The battle of Lepanto could not compare with it. "Tell
your master," said he to the envoy at the conclusion of his audience,
"that this event has given me a hundred times more pleasure than fifty
victories like that which the League obtained over the Turk last year."
In the excess of his joy he did not forget to enjoin on every one he
spoke to, especially all Frenchmen, to light bonfires in honor of the
massacre, hinting that whoever should fail to do so must be unsound in
the faith.<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> A few weeks later, the pontiff shocked even some devout
Roman Catholics by allowing Cardinal Lorraine and the French ambassador
to present to him Maurevel, the assassin who had fired the arquebuse shot
at Admiral Coligny.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">French boasts go for nothing.</div>

<p>"The pontiff," says his countryman, the historian Adriani, "and all Italy
universally rejoiced greatly, and forgave the king and queen their
previous dissimulation."<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> For the French at Rome now pretended that
the massacre had long been planned by their monarch, and that every favor
to the Huguenots for the past two years had been shown to them merely for
the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span> of lulling them into a false security. The Pope accepted the
plea without troubling himself much whether it were true or not,
satisfied as he was with the event. But not so the Spanish envoy at the
Roman court, Don Juan de Cuñiga. "The French wish to give the
impression," he wrote to his master, "that the king meditated this blow
from the time he made peace with the Huguenots; and, in order that it may
be believed that he was capable of preparing it and concealing it until
the proper time for the execution, they attribute to him stratagems which
do not seem allowable even against heretics and rebels. I deem it certain
that, if the shooting of the arquebuse at the admiral was a thing
projected a few days beforehand, and authorized by the king, all the rest
was inspired by circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> Equally positive, though not at all
doubtful respecting the morality of the transaction, and more jubilant,
was the Nuncio Salviati, in Paris. While desiring that the cardinal
secretary "should kiss the feet of his Holiness in his name," and
"rejoicing with him in the bowels of his heart at the blessed and
honorable commencement of his pontificate,"<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> while declaring that,
despite his previous belief that the court of France would not much
longer tolerate the admiral's arrogance, he would never have imagined the
tenth part of what he now saw with his own eyes, he also stated he could
not bring himself to believe that, had the admiral been killed by
Maurevel's shot, so much would have been done by a great deal.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> Now,
however, "the queen intended not only to revoke the Edict of
Pacification, but by means of justice to restore the ancient observance
of the Catholic faith."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine writes to Philip, her son-in-law.</div>

<p>There was another monarch whose joy was not less sincere than Gregory's.
This was Philip of Spain. Catharine had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span> not delayed writing to her royal
son-in-law. In her endeavor to make capital out of the massacre she
betrayed great satisfaction at her supposed masterly stroke of policy.
Her letter&mdash;a misspelled scrawl&mdash;furnishes a fresh illustration of the
fact that singular shrewdness in planning and executing criminal projects
is not incompatible with a trust, amounting almost to fatuity, in the
unsuspecting credulity of others. Catharine actually imagined that she
could, by her counterfeit piety, impose upon one who knew her character
so well as Philip of Spain. Therefore she was lavish of the use of the
name of the Deity to cover her own villainy. "Monsieur my son," she
wrote, "I entertain no doubt that you will appreciate, as we do, the
happiness God has conferred upon us in giving the king, my son, the means
of ridding himself of his subjects, rebels against God and himself, and
[rejoice] that it has pleased Him graciously to preserve him and us all
from the cruelty of their hands. For this we are assured that you will
praise God with us, as well on our account as for the advantage that will
accrue to all Christendom, and to the service, and honor, and glory of
God. This, we hope, will soon be made known, and the fruit thereof be
perceived.<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> By this event we afford the testimony of our good and
upright intentions, which have never tended but to His honor. And I
rejoice still more that this occasion will confirm and augment the
friendship between your Majesty and the king your brother&mdash;which is the
thing I desire most of all in this world."<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The delight of Philip the Second.</div>

<p>Philip had good reason to be glad. To all human appearance it had
depended only upon the word of Charles to secure, at once and forever,
the independence from the Spanish tyranny of the provinces on the lower
Rhine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span> which, under William of Orange, were battling for religious and
civil freedom. True, Genlis and his small forces had been captured or
destroyed; but what were they in comparison with the men whom the French
king could have marshalled under the command of Coligny, La Noue, and
other experienced leaders? And now Charles, at a single stroke, had cut
off all prospect of obtaining the sovereignty of the Netherlands or of
any part, had assassinated his own generals in their beds, had butchered
in cold blood those who would gladly have marched as soldiers to achieve
his conquests, and had freed Philip from all fear of French interference
in behalf of the Dutch patriots. No wonder then, that, when a courier,
sent by the Spanish ambassador at Paris, with tidings of the events of
St. Bartholomew's Day, reached Madrid, on the evening of Saturday, the
seventh of September&mdash;so slowly did news travel in those days&mdash;Philip was
almost beside himself with joy.<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> "He showed so much gayety, contrary
to his native temperament and custom," the French envoy, St. Goard, wrote
to his master, "that he was evidently more delighted than with all the
pieces of good fortune that had ever befallen him; and he called to him
his familiars to tell them that he knew that your Majesty was his good
brother, and that he saw that there was no one else in the world that
deserved the title of 'Very Christian.'" Not content with gloating over
the bloody bulletin with his cronies, he promptly sent his secretary,
Cayas, to congratulate the French ambassador, and to inform him that "the
king his master was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span> going that very hour to St. Jerome, to render all
manner of thanks to God, and to pray that in matters of so great
importance his Majesty might be sustained by His hand." When, the next
morning, St. Goard had been very graciously admitted to an audience, he
tells us that Philip&mdash;the man who rarely or never gave a hearty or manly
expression to his feelings&mdash;"began to laugh, and, with demonstrations of
extreme pleasure and satisfaction, praised your Majesty as having earned
your title of 'Very Christian,' telling me there was no king that could
claim to be your companion, either in valor or in prudence." It was
natural that Philip should chiefly extol Charles's alleged dissimulation,
and dwell on the happiness of Christendom saved from a frightful war. It
was equally politic for St. Goard to chime in, and echo his master's
praise. But there was sound truth in the concluding remark he made to
Philip: "However this may be, <i>Sire, you must confess that you owe your
Netherlands to his Majesty, the King of France</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles instigates the murder of French prisoners.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Duke of Alva jubilant but wary.</div>

<p>We have also more direct testimony to Philip's delight at the Parisian
massacre, in the form of a letter from the monarch to the Duke of Alva.
In this extraordinary communication, worthy of the depraved source from
which it emanated, the bloodthirsty king does not attempt to conceal the
satisfaction with which he has received the tidings of Charles's
"honorable and Christian resolution to rid himself of the admiral and
other important personages," both for religion's sake and because the
King of France will now be a firmer friend to the Spanish crown&mdash;since
neither the German Protestants nor Elizabeth will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span> trust him any
longer&mdash;a circumstance which will have a decided influence upon the
restoration of his authority in the Netherlands. Another matter upon
which he touches, places in the clearest light the infamy to which
Charles and his council had sunk, and the hypocrisy of Philip the
Catholic himself. Until the very moment of the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew's Day, Charles had been earnestly desirous of saving the
lives of the French Huguenots who had been taken prisoners with Genlis
near Mons; while, by the most barefaced assumptions of innocence, he
endeavored to induce the Spaniard to believe that he was in no way
responsible for Genlis's undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> Now, however, it is Charles
himself who, by his envoys at Madrid and Brussels, begs from Philip the
murder of his own French subjects, lest they return to do mischief in
France. Not only the soldiers taken with Genlis, but the garrison of
Mons, if that city, as now seemed all but certain, should fall into
Alva's hands, must be put to death.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> "If Alva object," he wrote to
Mondoucet, "that your request is the same thing as tacitly requiring him
to kill the prisoners and cut to pieces the garrison of Mons, you will
tell him that that is precisely what he ought to do, and that he will
inflict a very great wrong upon himself and upon all Christendom if he
shall do otherwise."<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> Drawing his inspiration from the same source,
St. Goard said to Philip himself: "One of the greatest services that can
be done for Christendom, will be to capture Mons and put everybody to the
edge of the sword."<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> And so Philip thought too; for he not only
wrote to Alva that the sooner the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span> earth were freed of such bad plants,
the less solicitude would be necessary in future, but he scribbled with
his own hand on the draft of the letter: "I desire, if you have not
already rid the world of them, you should do it at once and let me know,
for I see no reason for delay."<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> The more clear-headed Alva,
however, saw reasons not only for delay, but for extending to some of the
prisoners a counterfeit mercy; for he soon replied to his master, that
"he was not at all of opinion that it was best to cut off the heads of
Genlis and the other French prisoners, as the King of France asked him to
do. He had resolved to do so before the admiral's death, but now things
had changed. Charles must know that Philip has in his power men capable
of giving him great trouble."<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> None the less, however, did Alva
communicate the glad tidings to all parts of the Netherlands, and cause
solemn Te Deums to be sung in the churches.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> "These occurrences," he
wrote to Count Bossu, Governor of Holland, "come so marvellously apropos
in this conjunction for the affairs of the king our master, that nothing
could be more timely. For this we cannot sufficiently render thanks to
the Divine goodness."<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> Philip promptly sent the Marquis d'Ayamonte

special envoy at the French court, who returned soon after the massacre
to Brussels. On asking Catharine what reply he should carry back, the
Italian princess, intoxicated with her success, impiously said: "I do not
know that I can make any other answer than that which Jesus Christ gave
to St. John's disciples, 'Go and show again those things which ye have
seen and heard&mdash;the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the
lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have the gospel preached to them.'" "And do not forget," she added,
"to say to the Duke of Alva, 'Blessed is he, whosoever shall not be
offended in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span> me.'"<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Such was the new gospel of blood and rapine with

<div class="sidenote">England's horror.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Perplexity of the French ambassador at London.</div>

<p>But Spain and Rome were only exceptions. From almost every part of the
civilized world there arose a loud and unanimous cry of execration. It
was natural, however, that the feeling of horror should be deepest in the
neighboring Protestant countries, whose religion and liberties seemed to
be menaced with destruction by the treacherous blow. Above all, in
England with whose queen a matrimonial treaty had for months been
pending, the abhorrence of the crime and its perpetrators was the more
intense because of the violence of the revulsion. Resident Frenchmen were
startled at the sudden change. The warmest friends of France became its
open enemies, loudly reproaching the broken faith of the king, and
pouring curses upon the people that had exercised such indignities upon
unoffending citizens. If we may believe La Mothe Fénélon, the men who
customarily wore arms indulged in much insulting bravado and in threats
directed against any one that dared to gainsay them.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> The French
ambassador has himself left on record the description of a remarkable
interview which he had with Queen Elizabeth. Rarely had a diplomatic
agent been placed in a more embarrassing position. His letters and
despatches from home were of the most contradictory character. Scarcely
had he, with protestations of sincerity and truthfulness, published the
account of events in Paris which was sent him, when new instructions
arrived recalling, modifying, or contradicting the former. First, with
the startling news of the disturbance of the peace, by Admiral Coligny's
wounding, came a letter from the king, expressing "infinite displeasure"
at the "bad" and "unhappy" act, and a resolution to inflict "very
exemplary justice." To which this postscript was appended: "Monsieur de
la Mothe Fénélon, I will not forget to tell you that this wicked act
proceeds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span> the enmity between the admiral's house and the Guises, and
that I have taken steps to prevent their involving my subjects in their
quarrels, for I intend that my edict of pacification shall be observed in
every point."<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> Two days later Charles wrote again, communicating
intelligence of the massacre, beginning with the murder of Coligny, in
almost the identical words of the circular he was sending to Mandelot and
other governors of provinces and important cities.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> Still it is the
work of the Guises, and he himself has had enough to do in protecting his
own person in the castle of the Louvre. He wishes Queen Elizabeth to be
assured that he has no part in the deed,<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> and, in fact, that all
should know that he entertains great displeasure for what has so
unfortunately happened, and that it is the thing which he detests more
than anything else.<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> And he adds in a tone of well counterfeited
innocence: "I have near me my brother the King of Navarre, and my cousin
the Prince of Condé, to share in the same fortune with me."<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> After
receiving and spreading abroad these explanations, what must have been
the unfortunate ambassador's perplexity and annoyance, when he received,
but too late, a brief letter written on Monday, the day after the
massacre began, containing these words: "As we are beginning to discover
the conspiracy which the adherents of the pretended reformed religion had
entered into against me, my mother and my brothers, you will not speak of
the particulars of the disturbance, nor of its occasion until you receive
fuller and more certain intelligence from me; for, by to-night or
to-morrow morning, I hope to have cleared up the whole matter."<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> No
wonder the courier to whom the last letter was intrusted was bidden ride
with all speed to overtake the other; nor that La Mothe Fénélon hardly
knew how to extricate himself from the dilemma in which the king his
master had placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span> him. Had not Charles, by throwing all the blame, in
his first letter, upon the Guises and by positively denying any
participation of his own, unambiguously proclaimed his ignorance up to
that moment of any Huguenot conspiracy? How, then, could the French envoy
go to the same Englishmen to whom he had made known the contents of this
despatch, and tell them that the king was the author of the deed he had
stigmatized as most detestable, and that the motive that had impelled him
reluctantly to order the slaughter of the Huguenots was a conspiracy
which he did not discover until a day or two after he gave the order? Yet
this was the contradictory story which was sketched in the letter of the
twenty-fifth of August, and more fully elaborated in subsequent

<p>The crestfallen ambassador is said&mdash;and the authority for the disputed
statement is no less than that of the members of the queen's council,
Burleigh, Leicester, Knowles, Thomas Smith, and Croft&mdash;to have exclaimed
bitterly "that he was ashamed to be counted a Frenchman."<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> At first
he believed that an audience would be denied him; and when the queen at
last vouchsafed to see him at Woodstock, it was only after he had waited
three days in Oxford, while Elizabeth and her council met frequently to
deliberate upon the contents of Walsingham's despatches. He was admitted
to the private apartments of the queen, where he found her Majesty
surrounded by the lords of the council and the principal ladies of the
court, awaiting his coming in profound silence. Elizabeth advanced to
meet him, and greeted him with a countenance on which sorrow and severity
were mingled with more kindly feelings. Drawing the ambassador aside to a
window, she began the discourse with a dignity which few sovereigns have
ever known better how to assume. She gave particular expression to the
regret she felt in hearing such tidings from a prince in whom she had had
more confidence than in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span> living monarch. And when the
ambassador had stammered out the lying excuse based upon "the horrible
ingratitude and perverse intentions of the Huguenots" against his master,
and had tragically recounted the sorrow of Charles at being constrained
to cut off an arm to save the rest of the body, she replied that she
hoped that if the informations against the admiral and his were confirmed
by investigation, the king "might be excused in some part, both toward
God and the world, in permitting the admiral's enemies by force to
prevent his enterprises." But she would not admit that even then the
cruelty of the mode of punishment was capable of defence, most of all in
the case of Coligny, who, "being in his bed, lamed both on the right hand
and left arm, lying in danger under the care of chyrurgions, being also
guarded about his private house with a number of the king's guard, might
have been, by a word of the king's mouth, brought to any place to have
answered when and how the king should have thought meet." But she
preferred to ascribe the fault, not to Charles, but to those around him
whose age and knowledge "ought in such case to have foreseen how
offenders ought to be justified with the sword of the prince, and not
with the bloody swords of murderers, being also the mortal enemies of the
party murdered."<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth's council was even more outspoken. "Doubtless," said they, "the
most heinous act that has occurred in the world, since the crucifixion of
Jesus Christ, is that which has been recently committed by the French; an
act which the Italians and the Spaniards, ardent as they are, are far
from applauding in their heart, since it was a deed too full of blood,
for the greater part innocent, and too much suspected of fraud, which had
violated the pledged security of a great king, and disturbed the serenity
of the royal nuptials of his sister, insupportable to be heard by the
ears of princes, and abominable to all classes of subjects, perpetrated
contrary to all law, divine or human, and without a parallel among all
acts ever undertaken in the pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>ence of any prince, and which has even
rather involved the King of France in danger than rescued him from
it."<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ambassador disheartened.</div>

<p>The success of the French ambassador, therefore, was not flattering. The
most that he could do was to correct the impression that the massacre was
only a part of a more general plan for the extirpation of Protestantism
everywhere. But when the news came of the barbarous butchery of Huguenots
in Lyons and elsewhere; when Villiers, Fuguerel, and other Protestant
ministers escaping from France, brought to London the report that one
hundred thousand victims to religious intolerance had fallen since St.
Bartholomew's Day;<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> when English merchants who had witnessed the
scenes of horror at Rouen returned, bringing a true account of what had
occurred; when they overturned the audacious assertion that religion had
nothing to do with the deed, by declaring that the Huguenots whose lives
were spared were constrained to go to mass; that numbers had lost their
lives who might have saved them by consenting to take part in services
which they regarded as idolatrous; that there were instances of children
taken from their parents, and forcibly rebaptized; when, in short, every
assertion of La Mothe Fénélon was disproved, the irritation of the
English grew deeper. And at last the French ambassador was forced to
confess that they would believe neither him nor the despatches that he
occasionally produced, saying that the event, which is wont to give the
lie to words and letters, showed them what they had to fear.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> The

regarded it as a measure of self-defence to put to death so open a
sympathizer with the work of persecution. La Mothe Fénélon, disheartened,
promised Catharine de' Medici to do all that he could to promote the
interests of France, but the chief influence must come from the king and
herself. "Otherwise," he said, "your word will come to be of no
authority, and I shall become ridiculous in everything that I tell them
or promise them in your name."<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter of Sir Thomas Smith.</div>

<p>About the same time one of the most acute statesmen, one of the most
vigorous writers of the age, Sir Thomas Smith, himself a former
ambassador at the French court, correctly and eloquently expressed the
universal feeling of true Protestants in England, in a letter to
Walsingham which has become deservedly famous. "What warrant can the
French make, now seals and words of princes being traps to catch
innocents and bring them to the butchery? If the admiral and all those
murdered on that bloody Bartholomew day were guilty, why were they not
apprehended, imprisoned, interrogated, and judged, but so much made of as
might be, within two hours of the assumation? Is that the manner to
handle men either culpable or suspected? So is the journeyer slain by the
robber; so is the hen of the fox; so is the hind of the lion; so Abel of
Cain; so the innocent of the wicked; so Abner of Joab. But grant they
were guilty&mdash;they dreamt treason that night in their sleep; what did the
innocent men, women, and children at Lyons? What did the sucking children
and their mothers at Roan (Rouen) deserve? at Cane (Caen)? at Rochel?...
Will God, think you, still sleep? Will not their blood ask vengeance;
shall not the earth be accursed that hath sucked up the innocent blood
poured out like water upon it?... I am glad you shall come home, and
would wish you were at home, out of that country so contaminate with
innocent blood, that the sun cannot look upon it but to prognosticate the
wrath and vengeance of God. The ruin and desolation of Jerusalem could

thence."<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's unsuccessful representations.</div>

<p>Neither Catharine nor Charles was insensible to the impression made upon
the English court by the French atrocities. It became important to
furnish, if possible, some more convincing proofs of the existence of a
Huguenot plot, since the assurances of both monarch and ambassador had
lost all weight. The papers of the admiral, both in Paris and in his
castle of Châtillon-sur-Loing, had been searched in vain for anything
which, even after the murder, might seem to justify the king in violating
his pledged word and every principle of law and right. Not a scrap of a
letter could be found inculpating him. Not the slightest approach to a
hint that it would be well to make way with the king or any of the royal
family. The most private manuscripts of the admiral, unlike those of many
courtiers even in our own day, contained not a disrespectful expression,
nothing that could be twisted into a mark of disaffection or treason.
Catharine could lay her hand upon nothing that suited her purpose better
than the paper, which, as stated in a former chapter,<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> she showed to
Walsingham, wherein he advised Charles to keep Elizabeth and Philip "as
low as he could, as a thing that tended much to the safety and
maintenance of his crown." But the finesse of the queen mother failed of
accomplishing its object; for neither Elizabeth nor Walsingham would
think less of Coligny for proving himself faithful to his own sovereign's
interests. Elizabeth's incredulity was, doubtless, enhanced by the
hypocritical pretence of Catharine that her son intended to maintain his
edict of pacification in full force.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> "The king's meaning is," the
queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span> mother once said to the English envoy, "that the Huguenots shall
enjoy the liberty of their conscience." "What, Madam," observed
Walsingham, "and the exercise of their religion too?" "No," Catharine
replied, "my son will have exercise but of one religion in his realm."
"Then, how can it agree, that the observation of the edict, whereof you
willed me to advertise the queen my mistress, that the same should
continue in his former strength?" interposed Walsingham. To that
Catharine answered "that they had discovered certain matters of late,
that they saw it necessary to abolish all exercise of the same." "Why,
Madam," said the puzzled and somewhat pertinacious diplomatist, "will you
have them live without exercise of religion?" "Even," quoth Catharine,
who fancied that she had discovered a pertinent retort, "even as your
mistress suffereth the Catholics of England." But the ambassador could
not be so easily silenced. Parrying the home thrust, and trenching on an
uncourtly bluntness of speech, he quietly called attention to a
distinction which her Majesty had not perhaps observed. "My mistress did
never promise them anything by edict; if she had, she would not fail to
have performed it." After that, there was plainly nothing more to be
said, and Catharine resorted to the usual refuge of worsted argument, and
said: "The queen your mistress must direct the government of her own
country, and the king my son his own."<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Briquemault and Cavaignes hung for alleged conspiracy.</div>

<p>Some victims were needed to be immolated upon the altar of justice to
atone for the alleged Huguenot conspiracy. They were found in Briquemault
and Cavaignes, two distinguished Protestants. The former, a knight of the
royal order, had, contrary to all rules of international law, been
forcibly taken from the house of the English ambassador, whither he had
fled for refuge.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> It was not difficult for the court to obtain what
was desired from the cowardly parliament over which Christopher de Thou
presided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span> Convicted by false testimony, and complaining that even their
own words were falsified by their partial judges, the two Protestants
were publicly hung on the Place de Grève. It was noticed that they both
died exhibiting great fortitude,<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> and protesting to the last that
they had neither taken part in, nor even heard of any plot against the
king or the state. Charles, hardened by the sight of so much blood,
wished to witness in person this new spectacle also, and not only looked
on from a neighboring window, but, as it was too dark to see the
sufferers distinctly, ordered torches to be lighted, and diverted himself
with great laughter in observing their expiring agonies. The King of
Navarre and the Prince of Condé were likewise forced to be present, in
order to give color to the absurd story that one or both had been
included among those whom Coligny and the Huguenots had intended to
murder. An hour after, and the Parisian populace cut down the bodies,
dragged them in contumely through the streets, and amused themselves by
stabbing them, shooting at them, and maiming them. It was an additional
aggravation of the judicial crime and the king's ill-timed merriment,
that the execution took place on the evening of the day upon which the
young Queen of France gave birth to Charles's only legitimate child&mdash;a
daughter, whom the Salic law excluded from the succession to the throne.
Still unconvinced of Coligny's guilt, even by the conviction and death of
Brique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>mault and Cavaignes, Queen Elizabeth very frankly expressed to La
Mothe Fénélon her deep regret that her brother, the French king, had
profaned the day of his daughter's birth by the sanguinary spectacle he
had that evening gone to behold.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The news in Scotland;</div>

<p>In Scotland, when the news of the massacre arrived, the aged reformer,
John Knox, summoned all his remaining energy to preach a last time before
the regent and the estates. In the midst of his sermon, turning to Du
Croc, the French ambassador, who was present, he sternly addressed to him
these prophetic words: "Go tell your king that sentence has gone out
against him, that God's vengeance shall never depart from him nor his
house, that his name shall remain an execration to the posterities to
come, and that none that shall come of his loins shall enjoy that kingdom
unless he repent." The indignant ambassador called upon the regent "to
check the tongue which was reviling an anointed king;" but the regent
refused to silence the minister of God, and suffered Du Croc to leave
Edinburgh in anger.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">in Germany;</div>

<p>Monsieur de Vulcob, the French ambassador at the court of the Emperor of
Germany, was equally unsuccessful in convincing that monarch of the truth
of the story contained in his despatches from Paris. The emperor did not
disguise his great disappointment and sorrow, nor his belief that the
murderous project had been known for weeks before at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> It need
scarcely be said that the negotiations of Schomberg, who had been sent to
procure an offensive and defensive alliance between the Protestant
princes of Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span> and the crown of France, were rendered abortive by
the advent of tidings of the treacherous massacre at Paris. Like the rest
of the diplomatists sent out from France, the able envoy to Germany had
been left in profound ignorance of the blow that was to disturb all his
calculations. He had even been empowered to promise that Charles would
assume toward the enterprise of William of Orange the same position that
the princes would take; and he seemed likely to be successful in inducing
the princes to make common cause with his master.</p>

<p>To Schomberg, as to the rest, there had been despatched, on the very day
that Coligny was wounded, a narrative of that event to be laid before the
Protestant princes&mdash;a narrative wherein the occurrence was deplored;
wherein Charles stated that he had taken just such measures for the
apprehension of the perpetrator of the crime as he would have taken had
the victim been one of his own brothers; wherein he promised to spare
neither diligence nor trouble, and to inflict condign punishment, "in
order that all men might know that no greater misdeed could have been
committed in his kingdom, nor more displeasing to himself;" wherein he
protested his unalterable determination to maintain completely and
sedulously his edict of pacification.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> But to Schomberg, as to the
other French ambassadors, there had come subsequent tidings and
despatches giving the lie to all these assurances.</p>

<p>And now, as he wrote home with some bitterness, "all his negotiations had
ended in smoke."<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> Their Highnesses "could not get it out of their
heads" that the events of St. Bartholomew's Day were premeditated, with
the view of enabling the Duke of Alva to make way with the forces of the
Prince of Orange. So high did feeling run, that the rumor prevailed that
Schomberg had been thrown into prison as an accomplice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span> in the perfidy,
and that Coligny's death was about to be avenged upon him.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p>Instead of forming an alliance with Charles, the Landgrave of Hesse and
the three Protestant electors began instantly to concert measures of
defence against what they verily believed to be a general war of
extermination, set on foot by the Pope and his followers, in pursuance of
the resolutions of the Council of Trent. "The princes of the Augsburg
Confession," wrote Landgrave William to the Electors of Saxony and
Brandenburg, "can see in this inhuman incident, as in a mirror, how the
papists are disposed toward all the professors of the pure doctrine. The
Pope and his party follow even at this day the rule which they followed
respecting John Huss in the Council of Constance. When it is their
interest so to act, they do not deem themselves bound to keep any faith
with heretics.... Last year the Pope and his followers obtained a
glorious victory over the Turk. It is of the very nature of victories
that they commonly make the victors more insolent." To Frederick the
Pious, elector palatine, the landgrave wrote a day later: "There is
nothing better for us Germans than to have nothing to do with them; for
neither credit nor confidence can be reposed in them." "I marvel
greatly," he added, "that the admiral and the other Huguenot gentlemen,
although they, too, had doubtless studied Macchiavelli's 'Il
Principe'&mdash;<i>the Italian bible</i><a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>&mdash;should have been so trustful, and
should not have been too much upon their guard to suffer themselves to be
enticed unarmed into so suspicious a place."<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">In Poland.</div>

<p>Montluc, Bishop of Valence, had just been sent to Poland to endeavor to
secure the vacant throne for Henry of Anjou. His ultimate success and its
consequences will be seen in another place. But now the attempt seemed
desperate. The bishop, who was the most wily and experienced negotiator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
the French court possessed, and was fully conscious of his rare
qualifications, was vexed almost beyond endurance at the stupidity of the
king and queen who had employed him. "By the despatch I send the king,
and by what the Dean of Die will tell you," he wrote (on the twentieth of
November) to one of the secretaries of state, "you will learn how this
unfortunate blast from France has sunk the ship which we had already
brought to the mouth of the harbor. You may imagine how well pleased the
person who was in command of it has reason to be when he sees that by
another's fault he loses the fruit of his labors. I say another's fault,
for, since a desire was felt for this kingdom, the execution which has
been made might and ought to have been deferred."<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> Again and again
Montluc begged that there might be no repetition of such cruelties,
suggesting that an edict, guaranteeing that no one's conscience should be
constrained, might be made or fabricated. If the king had no intention of
carrying it into effect, he could at least send it to the governors, with
private orders to make such disposition of it as he pleased.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> But,
above all, there must be no fresh outrages done to the Protestants. "If
between this and the day of the election there were to come the news of
some cruelty," he wrote in midwinter, "we could do nothing, even had we
here ten millions in gold with which to gain men over. The king and the
Duke of Anjou will have to consider whether a purpose of revenge is of
more moment to them, than the acquisition of a kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a></p>

<p>The ministers of Geneva, somewhat removed from the mists that prevented
the greater part of the Huguenot leaders from descrying the perils
environing them, had long foreseen the coming catastrophe, and had in
vain implored Admiral Coligny, in particular, to have a greater care for
his safety. "How often have I predicted it to him! How often have I
warned him!" exclaimed Theodore Beza, in the first paroxysm of grief at
the assassination of his noble friend.<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> The city government,
participating in the same apprehensions, early in the fatal month of
August, 1572, instructed some of the reformed ministers who had occasion
to revisit their native land on private business, to hasten out of a
country where they were exposed to the treachery of a Florentine
woman.<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> Their solicitude was only too well grounded. On Saturday,
the thirtieth of August, some merchants arrived in Geneva from Lyons,
with the appalling intelligence that their Protestant countrymen were
everywhere the victims of unparalleled cruelty. From the inn they went on
without delay to the city hall, and narrated to the magistrates the
revolting atrocities of which they had been eye-witnesses. They besought
the city to prepare hospitable shelter and food for the throng of
refugees who would soon make their appearance, having scarce escaped the
bloody snares in which their brethren in great numbers had lost their
lives.<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> "The frightful news," writes the historian of the Genevan
church, describing the scene, "courses through the city with the speed of
lightning: the shops are closed, and the citizens assemble on the public
squares. They know, by past experience, the burdens and sacrifices that
await men of good-will. Within doors, the women get in readiness an
abundance of clothing, of medicines, and of food. The magistrates send
wagons and litters to the villages of the district of Gex; and the
peasants with their pastors take their station upon the border, to obtain
intelligence and to render assistance to the first that may arrive. They
have not long to wait. On the first of September a few travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span> make
their appearance, pale, worn out with fatigue, scarcely answering the
greeting they receive. They cannot credit the reality of their
deliverance. For days death has been lying in wait for them at the
threshold of every village. Soon their numbers increase. The wounded
uncover the wounds they have carefully concealed, that they might not be
taken for reformers. They declare that, since the twenty-sixth of August,
the country and the cities have been deluged with the blood of their
brethren."<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>Nobly did the citizens of the little commonwealth welcome the scarred and
bleeding confessors of their faith, contending with magnanimous rivalry
for the most cruelly mangled, and carrying them in triumph into their
homes and to their frugal boards. Not one refugee was suffered to find
his way to the city hall; and there was no need of any public
distribution of alms.<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> Within a few days twenty-three hundred
families of French Protestants were gathered in the hospitable inclosure
of Geneva. Besides those that subsequently returned to France, on the
arrival of more propitious times, more than two hundred of these families
yet remain, comprising the most honorable citizens of the republic.<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p>A solemn fast was instituted. In the presence of the remarkable assembly
gathered in the old cathedral of Saint Pierre, no word of threatening, no
prayer for vengeance was uttered. But a firm conviction of the power and
goodness of God seemed to dwell in every heart, and was uttered in
impressive words by Theodore Beza&mdash;since Calvin's death, eight years
before, the leading theologian of Geneva. "The hand of the Lord is not
shortened," said the reformer. "He will not suffer a hair of our head to
fall to the ground without His will. Let us not, therefore, be at all
affrighted because of the plot of the men who have unjustly devised to
put us all to death with our wives and our children. Let us rather be
assured, that, if the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span> has ordained to deliver all or any of us,
none shall be able to resist Him. If it shall please Him that we all die,
let us not fear; for it is our Father's good pleasure to give us another
home, which is the heavenly kingdom, in which there is no change, no
poverty, no want, no tear, no crying, no mourning, no sorrow, but, on the
contrary, eternal joy and blessedness. It is far better to be lodged with
the beggar Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham, than with the rich man, with
Cain, with Saul, with Herod, or with Judas, in hell. Meanwhile, we must
drink the cup which the Lord has prepared for us, each according to his
portion. We must not be ashamed of the Cross of Christ, nor be loth to
drink the gall of which He has first drunk: knowing that our sorrow shall
be turned into joy, and that we shall laugh in our turn, when the wicked
shall weep and gnash their teeth."<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>Twenty Huguenot pastors from France were among the refugees, and were
kindly invited to take part in the honorable office of preaching in the
churches. They preferred, however, to sit among the hearers, and listen
to the sermons of Beza and his venerated colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their generosity and danger.</div>

<p>Heaven smiled on the generous hospitality of the little republic. The
plague, which had been raging in Geneva, disappeared simultaneously with
the arrival of the fugitives from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span> France.<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> Still the burden which
their hosts had assumed was by no means light. They were not rich, and
the rigorous winter that followed would have reduced them to great
straits even without this additional drain upon their resources. Besides,
they had incurred the dangerous enmity of the King of France. While
professing deep gratitude to the Genevese for the advice they had given
to the Protestants of Nismes to liberate the agents of the royal court,
who had been sent to procure their destruction, but had been discovered
and incarcerated, Charles the Ninth was in secret plotting the ruin of
the city which furnished an asylum to so many of his persecuted subjects.
At one time the danger was imminent. The Duke of Savoy was reported to
have collected an army of eighteen thousand men near Chambéry and Annecy,
while rumors of domestic treachery took so definite a form, that it was
said that two hundred papal soldiers in the disguise of Protestant
refugees were lurking in Geneva itself. On the other hand, the Roman
Catholic cantons of Fribourg and Soleure, when on the point of joining
Berne and Zurich in sending assistance, undertook to stipulate for the
reinstatement of the mass within the walls of Geneva; and the Genevese,
who, whatever other faults they might possess, were no cowards, declined
an alliance upon such conditions.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> But the threatened contest of
arms never came. By one of those strange turns of affairs, which, from
their frequent recurrence in the history of Geneva, an impartial beholder
can scarcely interpret otherwise than as interpositions of providence in
behalf of a city that was destined for ages to be a safe refuge for the
oppressed confessors of a purer faith, the storm was dissipated as
rapidly as it had gathered. The bodily ailments of Charles the Ninth
were, humanly speaking, the salvation of Geneva.<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p>In other parts of Switzerland the King of France made great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span> efforts to
counteract the injurious influence upon his interests which the
intelligence of the massacre could but exert. Almost immediately after
the events of the last week of August, the royal ambassador, Monsieur de
la Fontaine, and the treasurer whom the French monarch was accustomed to
keep in Switzerland, were instructed to write out an account for the
benefit of his Majesty's "best and perfect friends," "the magnificent
seigniors," wherein among the numerous falsehoods with which they
attempted to feed the unsophistical mountaineers, was at least a single
truth: "This young and magnanimous prince, since his accession to the
throne, has, so to speak, reaped only thorns in place of a
sceptre."<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Impression at Baden.</div>

<p>A little later M. de Bellièvre, his special envoy at the diet of Baden,
was profuse in assurances to the effect that the deed was not
premeditated, but had been rendered necessary by the machinations of the
admiral&mdash;"a wretched man, or rather, not a man, but a furious and
irreconcilable beast who had lost all fear of God and man." He
particularly defended the king from all responsibility for the excesses
that had been committed, insisting that it was the people that "had taken
the bit in its teeth," while Charles, Anjou, and Alençon, did their best
to check its mad impetuosity, and Catharine felt "unspeakable
regret."<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> But the envoy had little reason to congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span> himself
upon his success. "Sire," he wrote with some disgust to his master, "it
is all but impossible to get it out of the heads of the Protestants, that
your Majesty's intention is to join the rest of the Catholic princes, in
order by force to put (the decrees of) the Council of Trent into
execution in their countries." They would not be satisfied entirely by
Bellièvre's plausible explanations. "Simple and rude people are violently
excited by such things, and are very difficult to be reassured."<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Medals and vindications.</div>

<p>Charles the Ninth stood convicted in the eyes of the world of a great
crime. No elaborate vindications, by their sophistry, or by barefaced
misstatements of facts, could clear him, in the judgment of impartial men
of either creed, from the guilt of such a butchery of his subjects as
scarcely another monarch on record had ever perpetrated. Medals were
early struck in honor of the event, upon which "valor and piety"&mdash;the
king's motto&mdash;were represented as gloriously exhibited in the destruction
of rebels and heretics.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> But the wise regarded it as "a cruelty
worse than Scythian," and deplored the realm where "<i>neither piety nor
justice</i> restrained the malice and sword of the raging populace."<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a>
The Protestants of all countries&mdash;and they were his natural allies
against Spanish ambition for world-empire&mdash;had forever lost confidence in
the honor of Charles of Valois.</p>

<p class='center'>Multis minatur, qui uni facit, injuriam. </p>

<p>"If that king be author and doer of this act," wrote the Earl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span> of
Leicester, expressing the common judgment of the civilized world, "shame
and confusion light upon him; be he never so strong in the sight of men,
the Lord hath not His power for naught.... If he continue in confirming
the fact, and allowing the persons that did it, then must he be a prince
detested of all honest men, what religion soever they have; for as his
fact was ugly, so was it inhumane. For whom should a man trust, if not
his prince's word; and these men he hath put to slaughter, not only had
his word, but his writing, and not public, but private, with open
proclamations and all other manner of declarations that could be devised
for the safety, which now being violated and broken, who can believe and
trust him?"<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disastrous effects of the massacre on Charles himself.</div>

<p>Upon the king himself the results of the fearful atrocities which he had
been induced by his mother and brother to sanction, were equally lasting
and disastrous. The change was startling even to those who were its chief
cause: from a gentle boy he had become transformed into a morose and
cruel man. "The king is grown now so bloody-minded," writes one who
enjoyed good opportunities of observing him, "as they that advised him
thereto do repent the same, and do fear that the old saying will prove
true," "<i>Malum consilium consultori pessimum</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> The story of the
frenzy of Charles who, on one occasion, seemed to be resolved to take the
lives of Navarre and Condé, unless they should instantly recant, and was
only prevented by the entreaties of his young wife, may be
exaggerated.<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> But certain it is that the unhappy king was the victim
of haunting memories of the past, which, while continually robbing him of
peace of mind, sometimes drove him to the borders of madness. Agrippa
d'Aubigné tells us, on the often repeated testimony of Henry of Navarre,
that one night, a week after the massacre, Charles leaped up in affright
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span> his bed, and summoned his gentlemen of the bedchamber, as well as
his brother-in-law, to listen to a confused sound of cries of distress
and lamentations, similar to that which he had heard on the eventful
night of the butchery. So convinced was he that his ears had not deceived
him, that he gave orders that the new attack which he fancied to be made
upon the partisans of Montmorency should at once be repressed by his
guards. It was not until the soldiers returned with the assurance that
everything was quiet throughout the city, that he consented to retire to
his rest again. For an entire week the delusive cries seemed to return at
the self-same hour.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> These fancies&mdash;the creations of his fevered
brain&mdash;may soon have left him, not to return until the general closing in
at the death-bed. But there were marks of the violence of the passions of
which he was the victim in his altered mien and deportment. Even before
the event that has fixed upon him an infamous notoriety, he acted at
times like a madman in the indulgence of his whims and coarse tastes. Sir
Thomas Smith, five months before the fatal St. Bartholomew's Day, wrote
of "his inordinate hunting, so early in the morning and so late at night,
without sparing frost, snow or rain, and in so desperate doings as makes
her (his mother) and them that love him to be often in great fear."<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a>
But now the picture, as faithfully drawn by the friendly hand of the
Venetian ambassador, early in the year 1574, is still more pitiful. His
countenance had become sad and forbidding. When obliged to give audience
to the representatives of foreign powers, as well as in his ordinary
interviews, he avoided the glance of those who addressed him. He bent his
head toward the ground and shut his eyes. At short intervals he would
open them with a start, and in a moment, as though the effort caused him
pain, he would close them again with no less suddenness. "It is feared,"
adds the writer, "that the spirit of vengeance has taken possession of
him; formerly he was only severe, now his friends dread lest he will
become cruel." He must at all hazards find hard work to do. He was on
horseback for twelve or fourteen consecutive hours, and pursued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span> same
deer for two or three days, stopping only to take nourishment, or snatch
a little rest at night. His hands were scarred and callous. When in the
palace, his passion for violent exercise drove him to the forge, where
for three or four hours he would work without intermission, with a
ponderous hammer fashioning a cuirass or some other piece of armor, and
exhibiting more pride in being able to tire out his gentle competitors,
than in more royal accomplishments.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> We have no means of tracing
accurately the influence of the massacre upon others. The Abbé Brantôme,
however, early pointed out the remarkable fact that of those who took a
principal part in the work of murder and rapine many soon after met with
violent deaths, either at the siege of La Rochelle or in the ensuing
wars, and that the riches they had so iniquitously accumulated profited
them little.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">How far was the Roman Church responsible?</div>

<p>Before dismissing the consideration of the stupendous crime for which
Divine vengeance&mdash;to use the words of Sully&mdash;"made France atone by
twenty-six consecutive years of disaster, carnage, and horror,"<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> it
is at once interesting and important to glance at a historical question
which still agitates the world, and for a correct and impartial solution
of which we are, perhaps, more favorably situated than were even the
contemporaries of the event. I allude to the inquiry respecting the
extent to which the Roman Church, and the Pope in particular, must be
held responsible for the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as Queen Catharine was concerned (and the same is true of some of
her advisers), it is admitted by all that no zeal for religion controlled
her conduct. A dissolute and ambitious woman, and, moreover, almost an
avowed atheist, she could not have acted from a sincere but mistaken
belief that it was her duty to exterminate heresy. But among the inferior
agents it can scarcely be doubted that there were some who believed
themselves to be doing God service in ridding the world of the enemies of
His church. Had not the preachers in their sermons extolled the deed as
the most meritorious that could be performed, and as furnishing an
unquestionable passport to paradise? The number, however, of these
<i>religious</i> assassins&mdash;if so we may style them&mdash;could be but small in
comparison with the multitude of those to whom religion served merely as
a pretext, while cupidity or partisan hatred was the true motive; men
who, nevertheless, derived their incentive from the lessons of their
spiritual guides, and who would never have dreamed of giving loose rein
to their passions, but for the suggestions of these sanguinary teachers.
At the bar of history the priesthood that countenanced assassination must
be held no less accountable for the actions of this class than for the
deeds of more sincere devotees.</p>

<p>It is immaterial to the question of the responsibility of the Papal
Church, whether the queen mother and the king's ministers were honest, or
were Roman Catholics, or, indeed, Christians only in name. If the Pope
had for years, by letter and by his accredited agents, been insinuating
that the life of a heretic was a thing of little value; if he
systematically advocated a war of extermination, and opposed every
negotiation for peace, every truce, every edict of pacification that did
not look to the annihilation of the Huguenots; if he had familiarized the
minds of king and queen with the thought of justifiable massacre, it is
of little importance to ascertain whether his too ready pupils executed
the injunction from a pure desire to further the interests of the Papal
See, or with more selfish designs. Unfortunately for humanity and for
religion, the course I have indicated was that which had been
consistently and indefatigably pursued during the entire pontificate of
Pius the Fifth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span> and during the few months that had elapsed since the
election of his successor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gregory probably not aware of the intended massacre.</div>

<p>Contrary to the firm persuasion of the Protestants who wrote contemporary
accounts of the massacre, we must in all probability, as we have already
seen,<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> acquit Gregory the Thirteenth of any knowledge of the
disaster impending over the admiral and the Huguenots. It was what he
wished for and prayed for, but with little hope of seeing the
accomplishment. In fact, he was brought to the verge of despair in
respect to the hold of the papacy upon the kingdom of France. Nuncio
Salviati, at Paris, had, indeed, conceived the hope that some disaster
would befall the Huguenots in consequence of Coligny's imprudence and the
desperation of the queen mother and of the Roman Catholic party at
finding the authority slipping from their hands. But his astonishment and
that of the pontiff at the general massacre of the Protestants was
surpassed only by their common delight. The fragments of the despatches
from Salviati to the Roman secretary of state, which have been suffered
to find their way into print, seem to settle this point beyond all
controversy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pius the Fifth instigates the French court.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He indorses the cruelties of Alva.</div>

<p>We have in previous chapters seen the Pope assisting Charles with money
and troops in the prosecution of the last two wars against the Huguenots.
But this aid was accompanied with perpetual exhortations to do the work
thoroughly, and not to repeat the mistakes committed by his predecessors.
"That heresy cannot be tolerated in the same kingdom with the worship of
the Catholic religion," writes Pius the Fifth to Sigismund Augustus of
Poland, "is proved by that very example of the kingdom of France, which
your Majesty brings up for the purpose of excusing yourself. If the
former kings of France had not suffered this evil to grow by neglect and
indulgence, they would easily have been able to extirpate heresy and
secure the peace and quiet of their realm."<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> Of all the leaders of
the day, the Duke of Alva alone earned, by his unrelenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span> destruction
of heretics, the unqualified approval of the pontiff. When the tidings of
the successes of the "Blood Council" reached Rome, Pius could not contain
himself for joy. He must congratulate the duke, and spur him on in a
course upon which the blessing of Heaven so manifestly rested. "Nothing
can occur to us," said he, "more glorious for the dignity of the Church,
or more delightful to the truly paternal disposition of our mind to all
men, than when we perceive that warriors and very brave generals, such as
we previously knew you to be and now find you in this most perilous war,
consult not their own interest, nor their own glory alone, but war in
behalf of that Almighty God who stands ready to crown His soldiers
contending for Him and His glory, not with a corruptible crown, but with
one that is eternal and fadeth not away."<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He repeatedly counsels exterminating the Huguenots.</div>

<p>With this express indorsement of Alva's merciless cruelty before us, it
is not difficult to understand what Pius demanded of Charles of France.
Early in 1569, while sending the Duke of Sforza with auxiliaries, he
wrote to the king: "When God shall by His kindness have given to you and
to us, as we hope, the victory, it will be your duty to punish the
heretics and their leaders with all severity, and thus justly to avenge
not only your own wrongs, but those of Almighty God: in order that, by
your execution of the righteous judgment of God, they may pay the penalty
which they have deserved by their crimes."<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> After the battle of
Jarnac and Condé's death, we have seen that Pius wrote promptly, bidding
Charles "pursue and destroy the remnants of the enemy, and wholly tear up
not only the roots of an evil so great and which had gathered to itself
such strength, but even the very fibres of the roots." He begged him not
to spare those who had not spared God nor their king.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> To Catharine
and to the Duke of Anjou, to the Cardinal of Bourbon, and to the Cardinal
of Lorraine, the same language was addressed. Again and again the Pope
held up the example of Saul, who disregarded the commands of the Lord
through Samuel and spared the Amalekites,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span> as a solemn warning against
disobedience. To the queen mother he said: "Under no circumstances and
from no considerations ought the enemies of God to be spared.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> If

never fail, and that still greater victories will be prepared by God for

to be inexorable in refusing the prayers of all who would intercede for
them.<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> Charles was given to understand that if, induced by any

<p>The victory of Moncontour furnished an occasion for fresh exhortations to
the king not to neglect to inflict upon the enemies of Almighty God the
punishments fixed by the laws. "For what else would this be," said Pius,
"than to make of no effect the blessing of God, namely, victory itself,
whose fruit indeed consists in this, that by just punishment the
execrable heretics, common enemies, having been taken away, the former
peace and tranquillity should be restored to the kingdom. And do not
allow yourself, by the suggestion of the empty name of pity, to be
deceived so far as to seek, by pardoning Divine injuries, to obtain false
praise for compassion; for nothing is more cruel than that pity and
compassion which is extended to the impious and those who deserve the
worst of torments."<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span> work begun by victories in the field was,
therefore, to be completed by the institution of inquisitors of the faith
in every city, and the adoption of such other measures as might, with
God's help, at length create the kingdom anew and restore it to its
former state.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p>As often as rumors of negotiations for peace reached him, Pius was in
anguish of soul, and wrote to Charles, to Catharine, to Anjou, to the
French cardinals, in almost the same words. He protested that, as light
has no communion with darkness, so no compact between Catholics and
heretics could be other than feigned and full of treachery.<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> As the
prospect of peace grew more distinct, his prognostications of coming
disaster grew darker, and sounded almost like threats. Even if the
heretics, in concluding the peace, had no intention of laying snares, God
would put it into their minds as a punishment to the king. "Now, how
fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, who is
wont not only to chastise the corrupt manners of men by war, but, on
account of the sins of kings and people, to dash kingdoms in pieces, and
to transfer them from their ancient masters to new ones, is too evident
to need to be proved by examples."<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> When at last the peace of Saint
Germain was definitely concluded, the Pope did not cease to lament over
"a pacification in which the conquered heretics imposed upon the
victorious king conditions so horrible and so pernicious that he could
not speak of them without tears." And he expressed at the same time his
paternal fears lest the young Charles and those who had consented to the
unholy compact would be given over to a reprobate mind, that seeing they
might not see, and hearing they might not hear.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a></p>

<p>To his last breath Pius retained the same thirst for the blood of the
heretics of France. He violently opposed the marriage of the king's

upon the life of a heretic; for, when the town of Mornas was on one
occasion captured by the Roman Catholic forces, and a number of prisoners
were taken, Pius&mdash;"such," his admiring biographer informs us, "was his
burning zeal for religion"&mdash;ransomed them from the hands of their
captors, that he might have the satisfaction of ordering their public
execution in the pontifical city of Avignon!<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> And when the same holy

that fell into his hands should straightway be put to death.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> As,

<p>With such continual papal exhortations to bloodshed, before us, with such
suggestive examples of the treatment which heretics ought, according to
the pontiff, to receive, and in the light of the extravagant joy
displayed at Rome over the consummation of the massacre, we can scarcely
hesitate to find the head of the Roman Catholic Church guilty&mdash;if not, by
a happy accident, of having known or devised the precise mode of its
execution, at least of having long instigated and paved the way for the
commission of the crime. Without the teachings of Pius the Fifth, the
conspiracy of Catharine and Anjou would have been almost impossible.
Without the preaching of priests and friars at Lent and Advent, the
passions of the low populace could not have been inflamed to such a pitch
as to render it capable of perpetrating atrocities which will forever
render the reign of Charles the Ninth infamous in the French annals.</p>

<blockquote><div class="sidenote">A German account of the massacre at Orleans.</div>

<p>One of the most vivid accounts of the massacre in any city
outside of Paris is the contemporary narrative of Johann
Wilhelm von Botzheim, a young German, who was at the time
pursuing his studies in Orleans. It forms the sequel to the
description of the Parisian massacre, to which reference has
already been made several times, and was first published by
Dr. F. W. Ebeling, in his "Archivalische Beiträge zur
Geschichte Frankreichs unter Carl IX." (Leipsic, 1872),
129-189. It was also translated into French by M. Charles
Read, for the number of the Bulletin de la Société de
l'histoire du protestantisme français issued on the occasion
of the tercentenary of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day.
The chief interest of the narration centres in the anxieties
and dangers of the little community of Germans in attendance
upon the famous law school. Besides this, however, much light
is thrown upon the general features of the bloody
transactions. The first intimation of Coligny's wounding
reached the Protestants as they were returning from the
prêche, but created less excitement because of the statement
accompanying it, that Charles was greatly displeased at the
occurrence. That night a messenger arrived with letters
addressed to the provost of the city, announcing the death of
the admiral and the Huguenots of Paris, and enjoining the like
execution at Orleans. Although the letters bore the royal
seal, the information they contained appeared so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span> incredible
that the provost commanded the messenger to be imprisoned
until two captains, whom he at once despatched to Paris,
returned bringing full confirmation of the story. The provost,
a man averse to bloodshed, issued, early on Monday morning as
a precautionary measure, an order to guard the city gates. But
the control of affairs rapidly passed out of his hands, and,
threatened with death because of his moderate counsels, the
provost was himself forced to take refuge for safety in the
citadel. Ten captains at the head of as many bands of
soldiers, ruled the city, and were foremost in the work of
murder and rapine that now ensued. But there were other bands
engaged in the same occupation, not to speak of single persons
acting strictly on their own account. Moreover, four hundred
ruffians came in from the country, intent upon making up for
losses which they pretended to have sustained during the late
civil wars. They showed no mercy to the Huguenots that fell
into their hands. Of the Protestants scarcely one made
resistance, so hopeless was their situation. Pierre Pillier, a
bell founder, had indeed barred his door with iron, but,
finding that his assailants were on the point of forcing the
entrance, he first threw his money from a window, and then,
seizing his opportunity when the miscreants were scrambling
for their prize, deluged them with molten lead, after which he
set fire to his house, and perished, with his wife and
children, in the flames.</p>

<p>There is, happily, no need of repeating here the shocking
details of the butchery told by the student. As a German, and
not generally known to be a Protestant, he managed to escape
the fate of his Huguenot friends, but he witnessed, and was
forced to appear to applaud, the most revolting exhibitions
both of cruelty and of selfishness. His favorite professor,
the venerable François Taillebois, after having been twice
plundered by bands of marauders, was treacherously conducted
by the second band to the Loire, despatched with the dagger,
and thrown into the river. "The last lecture, which he gave on
Monday at nine o'clock," says his pupil, "was on the <i>Lex
Cornelia</i> [de sicariis] of which he made the demonstration by
the sacrifice of his own life." It is pitiful to read that
even professors in the university were not ashamed to enrich
their libraries by the plunder of the law-books of their
colleagues, or of their scholars. The writer traced his own
copies of Alciat, of Mynsinger and "Speculator," to the
shelves of Laurent Godefroid, Professor of the Pandects, and
the entire library of his brother Bernhard to those of his
neighbor, Dr. Beaupied, Professor of Canon Law.</p>

<p>In the midst of the almost universal unchaining of the worst
passions of human or demoniacal nature, it is pleasant to note
a few exceptions. Some Roman Catholics were found not only
unwilling to imbrue their hands in the blood of their Huguenot
neighbors and friends, but actually ready to incur personal
peril in rescuing them from assassination. Such magnanimity,
however, was very rare. All respect for authority human or
divine, all sense of shame or pity, all fear of hell and hope
of heaven, seemed to have been obliterated from the breasts of
the murderers. The blasphemous words of the furious Captain
Gaillard, when opposed in his plan to destroy Botzheim and his
fellow Germans, truly expressed the sentiments which others
might possibly have hesitated to utter so distinctly. "Par la
mort Dieu! il faut qu'il<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span> soit.... Il n'y a ny Dieu, ny
diable, ny juge qui me puisse commander. Vostre vie est en ma
puissance, il fault mourir.... Baillez-moy mon espée, je
tuerai l'ung après l'autre, je ne saurois tuer trestous à la
fois avec la pistolle." Men, with blood-stained hands and
clothes, boasted over their cups of having plundered and
murdered thirty, forty, fifty men each. At last, on Saturday
afternoon, after the Huguenots had been almost all killed, an
edict was published prohibiting murder and pillage on pain of
death. Gallows, too, were erected in nearly every street, to
hang the disobedient; but not a man was hung, and the murders
still continued. Soon after a second edict directed the
restoration of stolen property to its rightful owners; it was
a mere trick to entice any remaining Huguenot from his refuge
and secure his apprehension and death. The Huguenots were not
even able to recover, at a later time, the property they had
intrusted to their Roman Catholic friends in time of danger,
and did not dare to bring the latter before courts of justice.
The Huguenots killed at Orleans, in this writer's opinion,
were at least fifteen hundred, perhaps even two thousand, in
number.</p></blockquote>

Charles IX. himself. They all seem to have been written by his inferior
agents, such as Puigaillard in the case of Saumur, or Masso and Rubys in
that of Lyons. The advantage of this course was apparent. The king could
not be <i>proved</i> to have ordered any massacre; he could throw off the
responsibility upon others. On the other hand, such politic governors as
Mandelot were naturally reluctant to act upon instructions which could at
any moment be disavowed. The verbal messages of Charles himself would
seem, from the Mandelot correspondence, to have been less
definite&mdash;perhaps going to no greater lengths than to order the arrest of
the persons and the sequestration of the effects of the Huguenots. May we
not naturally suppose that the king and his council counted upon such
subsequent massacres of the imprisoned Protestants as occurred in many
places?</p></div>

about seven hundred, and they would certainly not be inclined to

Goudimel, who set Marot's and Beza's psalms to music, and who was killed

both of Mandelot's having had no hand in the massacres of August 31st,
and of his utter want of principle, in the craven apology he makes, in
his letter of September 17th, for not having done more, on the ground
that he only knew his Majesty's pleasure as it were in a shadow, and very
late, and that he had rather feared the king would be angry at what the
people had done, than that so little had been done! "La pouvant asseurer

the conspiracy which the duke, Charles's youngest brother, had entered
into to prevent Henry of Anjou from succeeding peaceably to the throne of
France, the grateful Protestants at once opened their gates to him.

him of his instructions. The Protestant hastened on to warn his brethren
of their danger, while the messenger could only relate to the governor
the contents of the lost despatch. Notwithstanding this, eighty Huguenots
were murdered in one city (Aurillac) of this province. Massacre of St.

The authenticity of this letter has been much disputed, partly because of
the Viscount's severe and cruel character (which, however, D'Aubigné
himself notices when he tells the story), partly because it rests on the
sole authority of D'Aubigné. It is to be observed, however, that although
he alone relates it, he alludes to it in several of his works, as <i>e.g.</i>,
in his Tragiques. But the truth of the incident is apparently placed
beyond all legitimate doubt by its intimate and necessary connection with
an event which D'Aubigné narrates considerably later in his history, and
from personal knowledge. Hist. univ., ii. 291, 292 (liv. iii., c. 13). In
1577, D'Aubigné, having lost much of Henry of Navarre's favor through his
fidelity or his bluntness (see Mém. de d'Aubigné, éd. Panth., p. 486),
retired from Nérac to the neighboring town of Castel-jaloux, of which he
was in command. Making a foray at the head of a small detachment of
Huguenot soldiers, he fell in with and easily routed a Roman Catholic
troop, consisting of a score of light horsemen belonging to Viscount
D'Orthez, and a number of men raised at Bayonne and Dax, who were
conducting three young ladies condemned at Bordeaux to be beheaded. The
vanquished Roman Catholics threw themselves on the ground and sued for
mercy. On hearing who they were, D'Aubigné called to him all those who
came from Bayonne and then cried out to his followers to treat the rest
in memory of the massacre in the prisons of Dax. The Huguenots needed no
further reminder. It was not long before they had cut to pieces the
twenty-two men from Dax who had fallen into their hands. On the other
hand they restored to the soldiers of Bayonne their horses and arms, and,
after dressing their wounds in a neighboring village, sent them home to
tell their governor, Viscount D'Orthez, "that they had seen the different
treatment the Huguenots accorded to <i>soldiers</i> and to <i>hangmen</i>." A week
later, a herald from Bayonne arrived at Castel-jaloux, with worked scarfs
and handkerchiefs for the entire Huguenot band. Nor did the exchange of
courtesies end here. The mad notion seized Henry of Navarre to accept an
invitation to a feast extended to him by the Bayonnese. Six Huguenots
accompanied him, of whom D'Aubigné was one. The table was sumptuous, the
presents were rare and costly. D'Aubigné being recognized, was
overwhelmed with thanks, "his courtesy being much more liberally repaid
than he had deserved;" while the King of Navarre and his Huguenots, at
the table, "at the expense of the rest of France, extolled to heaven the
rare and unexampled act and glory of the men of Bayonne." It is certainly
an easier supposition that D'Aubigné has faithfully reproduced D'Orthez's
letter to Charles IX., than that he has manufactured so long and
consistent a story. The discussion in the Bulletin de la Soc. de
l'histoire du prot. franç. is full, xi. 13-15, 116, etc., xii. 240.</p></div>

The Jesuit Bonanni, in his "Numismata Pontificum" (2 vols. fol., Rome,

(Roma, 1838) vol. viii. 97. There are three paintings, of which the first
represents "the King of France sitting in parliament, and approving and
ordering that the death of Gaspard Coligny, Grand Admiral of France, and
declared to be head of the Huguenots, be registered." "The mischance of
Coligny is delineated in the following picture in a spacious square,
among many heads of streets (capistrade) and façades of temples. The
admiral, clothed in the French costume of that period, is carried in the
arms of several military men; although lifeless (estinto, read rather,
<i>faint</i>), he still preserves in his countenance threatening and terrible
looks." The third is the massacre of St. Bartholomew's day itself, in
which the beholder scarcely knows which to admire most, the artistic
skill of the painter, or his success in bringing into a narrow compass so
many of the most revolting incidents of the tragedy&mdash;the murder of men in
the streets, the butchery of helpless and unoffending women, the throwing
of Coligny's remains from the window of his room, etc. Dr. Henry White
gives a sketch of this painting, taken from De Potter's Lettres de Pie V.
Of the fresco representing the wounding of Coligny there is an engraving
in Pistolesi, <i>ubi supra</i>, vol. viii. plate 84. By an odd mistake, both
the text and the index to the plates, make this belong to the
reconciliation of Frederick Barbarossa and the pontificate of Alexander
III.&mdash;on what grounds it is hard to imagine. The character of the wound
of the person borne in the arms of his companions, indicated by <i>the loss
of two fingers of his right hand</i>, from which the blood is seen to be
dropping, leaves no doubt that he is the Admiral Coligny. Unfortunately,
Pistolesi's splendid work is disfigured by other blunders, or
typographical errors, equally gross. In describing other paintings of the
same Sala Regia (pp. 95, 96), he assigns, or is made by the types to
assign, various events in the quarrel of Barbarossa and Adrian IV. and
Alexander III., to the years 1554, 1555, 1577, etc.</p></div>

contemplation. When Mr. Motley says (United Netherlands, i. 15): "It is
as certain that Philip knew beforehand, and testified his approbation of
the massacre of St. Bartholomew, as that he was the murderer of Orange,"
the statement must be interpreted in accordance with that other statement
in the same author's earlier work (Rise of the Dutch Republic, ii. 388):
"The crime was not committed with the connivance of the Spanish
government. On the contrary, the two courts were at the moment bitterly
opposed to each other," etc. As the eminent historian can scarcely be
supposed to contradict himself on so important a point, we must
understand him to mean that Philip had, indeed, long since instigated
Catharine and her son to rid themselves of the Huguenot leaders by some
form of treachery or other, but was quite ignorant of, and unprepared
for, the particular means adopted by them for compassing the end.</p></div>

the court know some of the severe criticisms that were uttered respecting
a crime with which he had no sympathy. La Mothe Fénélon tells of the
impression, proved erroneous by the king's letter, "qu'ilz avoient que ce
fût ung acte projecté de longtemps, et que vous heussiez accordé avecques
le Pape et le Roy d'Espaigne de faire servir les nopces de Madame, vostre

and particularly that portion which branded with infamy their innocent
children, the courage of the old man of seventy, Briquemault, momentarily
failed, and he condescended to offer to do great services to the king in
retaking La Rochelle whose fortifications he had himself begun; and when
this proposal was rejected, it is said that he made more humiliating
advances. But the constancy and pious exhortations of his younger
companion, who sustained his own courage by repeating many of the psalms
in Latin, recalled Briquemault to himself, and from that moment "he had
nothing but contempt for death." De Thou (iv. 646), a youth of nineteen,
who was present in the chapel when the sentence was read, remembered the
incident well. Cf. Agrippa d'Aubigné, ii. 32 (bk. i., c. 6). Walsingham,
when he says in his letter of Nov. 1, 1572, that "Cavannes (Cavaignes)
showed himself void of all magnanimity, etc.," has evidently confused the
persons. Here is an instance where the later account of an
eye-witness&mdash;De Thou&mdash;is entitled to far more credit than the
contemporary statement of one whose means of obtaining information were
not so good.</p></div>

The worthy bishop, who was certainly at any time more at home in the
cabinet than in the church, did not intermit his toil or yield to
discouragement. If we may believe him, he "had not leisure so much as to
say his prayers." The panegyrists of the massacre, and especially
Charpentier, had done him good service by their writings, and at one time
he greatly desired that the learned doctor might be sent to his
assistance, particularly as (to use his own words) "all the suite of
Monsieur de l'Isle and myself do not know enough of Latin to admit a
deacon to orders, even at Puy in Auvergne." <i>Ubi supra.</i></p></div>

learned article on the massacre, in the North British Review for October,
1869, conveys an altogether unfounded and cruel impression, not only with
regard to Beza, but respecting his fellow Protestants, in these
sentences: "The very men whose own brethren had perished in France were
not hearty or unanimous in execrating the deed. There were Huguenots who
thought that their party had brought ruin on itself, by provoking its
enemies and following the rash counsels of ambitious men. This was the
opinion of their chief, Theodore Beza, himself," etc. The belief of Beza
that the French Protestants had merited even so severe a chastisement as
this at the hands of God, by reason of the ambition of some and the
unbelief or lack of spirituality of others, was a very different thing
from failing to execrate the deed with heartiness. If the words of
Bullinger to Hotman, quoted in support of the first sentence ("sunt tamen
qui hoc factum et excusare et defendere tentant") really referred to
Protestants at all, it can only have been to an insignificant number who
took the position from a love of singularity, and who were below
contempt. The execration of the deed was pre-eminently unanimous and
hearty.</p></div>

Monsieur de Chandieu received the news of the publication of Henry III.'s
edict of peace permitting the refugees to return home. All the
Protestants who had not adopted Switzerland as their future country
congregated at Geneva. A solemn religious service was held in the church
of Saint Pierre, where French and Genevese united in that favorite
Huguenot psalm (the 118th)&mdash;</p>

tender and affectionate terms to all the departments of government,
exclaiming: "We shall always regard the Church of Geneva as our
benefactress and our mother; and from all the French reformed churches
will arise, every Sunday, words of blessing, in remembrance of your
admirable benefits to us." The next day the refugees started for their
homes, accompanied, as far as the border, by a great crowd of citizens.

We have seen the anger of Paul IV., in 1558, upon learning that Henry II.

was for instantaneous execution, and <i>did not believe a heretic could

to heresy under every successive occupant of the papal throne. Letter of

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class='center'><a name="SEQUEL" id="SEQUEL"></a>THE SEQUEL OF THE MASSACRE, TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE NINTH.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Widespread terror.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
The blow had been struck by which the Huguenots were to be exterminated.
If a single adherent of the reformed faith still lived in Paris, he dared
not show his face. France had, as usual, copied the example of the
capital, and there were few districts to which the fratricidal plot had
not extended. Enough blood had been shed, it would seem, to satisfy the
most sanguinary appetite. After the massacre in which the admiral and all
the most noted leaders had perished&mdash;after the defection of Henry of
Navarre and his more courageous cousin, it was confidently expected that
the feeble remnants of the Huguenots, deprived of their head, could
easily be reduced to submission. The stipulation of Charles the Ninth,
when yielding a reluctant consent to the infamous project, would be
fulfilled: not one of the hated sect would remain to reproach him with
his crime. And, in point of fact, throughout the greater number of the
cities of France, even where there had been no actual massacre, so
widespread was the terror, that every Protestant had either fled from the
country or sought safety in concealment, if he had not actually
apostatized from the faith.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">La Rochelle and other cities in Protestant hands.</div>

<p>But when the storm had spent its first fury, and it became once more
possible to look around and measure its frightful effects, it was found
that the devastation was not universal. A few cities held for the
Huguenots. La Rochelle and Sancerre&mdash;the former on the western coast, the
latter in the centre of France&mdash;with Montauban, Nismes, Milhau, Aubenas,
Privas, and certain other places of minor importance in the south, closed
their gates, and refused to receive the royal governors sent them from
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> Not that there were wanting those, even among the
Protestants, who interposed conscientious scruples, and denied the right
of resistance to the authority of the king;<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> but with the vast
majority the dictates of self-preservation prevailed over the slavish
doctrine of unquestioning submission. The right to worship God as He
commands cannot, they argued, be abridged even by the legitimate
sovereign; and in this case there is even the greatest probability that
he acts under constraint, or that wily courtiers forge his name, since
the most contradictory orders emanate ostensibly from him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nismes.</div>

<p>Such was the attitude assumed by the brave inhabitants of Nismes. Here
the Roman Catholics had displayed a more charitable disposition than in
many other places. The "juge mage," on receipt of secret orders to
massacre the Protestants, instead of complying, gave directions for
assembling the extraordinary council, consisting of the magistrates and
most notable citizens. By this council, upon his recommendation, it was
unanimously resolved to close all the gates of Nismes, with the exception
of one. This was to be guarded in turn by the Roman Catholics and the
Protestants. All the citizens were directed to take a common oath that
they would assist each other without distinction of creed, and main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>tain
order and security, in obedience to the king's authority, and according
to the provisions of his edict of pacification. It was a solemn scene
when all those present in the great municipal meeting, the vicar-general
of the diocese among the number, with uplifted hands called upon God to
witness their engagement.<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> The oath was well observed. The Viscount
of Joyeuse, acting as lieutenant-governor of Charles in Languedoc, at
first approved the compact; for the king's early letters, as we have
seen, expressed indignation at Coligny's murder, and ascribed it to the
personal enmity of the Guises. But the viscount took a different view of
the matter when the monarch, throwing off the mask, himself accepted the
responsibility. Joyeuse now called on the citizens of Nismes to lay down
their arms, to expel all the refugees, and to receive a garrison. But the
Nismois firmly declined the summons, grounding their refusal partly on
their duty to themselves, partly on the manifest inhumanity of
surrendering their fellow-citizens to certain butchery. As was true in
more than one instance, it was the <i>people</i> that, by their decision,
saved the rich from the inevitable results of their own timid counsels.
Most of the judges of the royal court of justice, and most of the opulent
citizens, advocated a surrender of Nismes to Joyeuse, which must have
been the prelude to a fresh and perhaps indiscriminate massacre.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Montauban.</div>

<p>Scarcely less important to the Protestants of southern France was the
refuge they found in Montauban. Regnier, the same Huguenot gentleman who
had himself been rescued from slaughter at Paris by the magnanimity of
Vezins,<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> was the instrument of its deliverance. On finding himself
safe, his first impulse was to hasten to Montauban and urge his brethren
to adopt instant measures for self-defence. But despair had taken
possession of the inhabitants. They had heard that the dreaded black
cavalry of the ferocious Montluc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span> the men-at-arms of Fontenille, and
other troops, were on the march against them. Their enemies were already
reported to be so near the city as Castel-Sarrasin. Not a gate,
therefore, would the panic-stricken citizens close; not a sword would
they draw. Nothing was left but for Regnier, with the little band of less
than forty followers he had gathered, to abandon the devoted place. As he
was wandering about the country, uncertain whither to betake himself, he
unexpectedly fell in with the very enemy before whom Montauban was
quailing. Neither Regnier nor his handful of followers hesitated. It was
a glorious opportunity for the display of heroism in a good cause, for
there were ten Roman Catholics to one Protestant. Happily the ground was
favorable to the display of individual prowess; a river and a tributary
brook rendered the field so contracted that only a few men could fight
abreast. "Brethren and comrades," cried Regnier, "whether for life or for
combat, there is no other road than this." Then putting forward a
detachment of ten horsemen headed by an experienced leader, when he saw
the enemy pause to put on their helmets, he seized the opportunity in
true Huguenot fashion to act as the minister of his followers, and
uttered a brief prayer, devout and courageous. Next came the charge, such
as those men of iron determination knew well how to make. The van of the
enemy made no attempt to resist them; the cavalry in the centre was
driven back in confusion upon the mounted arquebusiers of the rear. The
fight became in a few minutes a disgraceful rout, and for a whole league
the handful of Huguenots continued the pursuit. Of nearly four hundred
royalists, eighty were killed and fifty captured. When Regnier, returning
to Montauban, brought the flags of the enemy and a body of prisoners
outnumbering his own band, the citizens renounced their fears, accepted
the omen as a pledge of Divine assistance, and cast in their lot with
their brethren of La Rochelle.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">La Rochelle the centre of interest.</div>

<p>For La Rochelle had now become the centre of interest, and Montauban,
Nismes, and even Sancerre, whose brave and obstinate siege will soon
occupy us, were for the time almost wholly dismissed from consideration.
The strongly fortified Protestant town, the only point upon the shores of
the ocean which during the former civil wars had defied every assault of
the papal leaders, was now the safe and favorite refuge of the Huguenots,
and the coveted prey of the enemy. Within a very short time after the
massacre, a stream of fugitives set in toward La Rochelle. It was not
long before her hospitable walls sheltered fifty of the Protestant nobles
of the neighboring provinces, fifty-five ministers, and fifteen hundred
soldiers, chiefly from Saintonge, Aunis, and Poitou. Among the new-comers
were not a few who had with difficulty escaped from the bloody scenes at
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> All were inspired with the same courage, all possessed by
the same determination to sell their lives as dear as possible; for the
successive accounts of the cruelties perpetrated in all parts of France
left no doubt respecting the fate of the Rochellois should they too
succumb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A spurious letter of Catharine de' Medici.</div>

<p>And there were not wanting circumstances of an alarming nature. At
Brouage, then a flourishing port some twenty-five miles south of La
Rochelle, a considerable body of troops had been gathered under Philip
Strozzi, the chief officer of the French infantry, while a fleet was in
course of preparation under the well-known Baron de la Garde. This
occurred previously to the massacre. The force, it was given out, was
intended for a secret expedition against the Spaniards. While the
Huguenots of Coligny, forming a junction with the troops of William of
Orange, should attack Alva in Flanders, Strozzi and La Garde were to make
a diversion upon the coasts of Spain itself. But the inhabitants of La
Rochelle gave little credit to this explanation, and even the personal
assurances of the admiral had not entirely removed their fears that their
own destruction was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>tended. It is not strange, therefore, that they
accepted the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day as a complete
demonstration of the correctness of their suspicions, and at once took
measures for protecting their city against surprise or open assault. Nor
is it altogether easy to ascertain how far their apprehensions were
unfounded. There were intelligent and well-informed contemporary writers,
who felt no doubt that Strozzi was waiting with sealed orders for the
coming of the fatal twenty-fourth of August. Two months before, they say,
there had been sent him by Catharine de' Medici a packet which he was
strictly forbidden to open until that day. It proved to be a letter of
instruction couched in these words: "Strozzi, I notify you that this day,
the twenty-fourth of August, the admiral and all the Huguenots who were
with him here have been slain. Consequently, take diligent measures to
make yourself master of La Rochelle, and do to the Huguenots who shall
fall into your hands the same that we have done to those who were here.
Take good heed that you fail not, insomuch as you fear to displease the
king my son, and myself. <span class="smcap">Catharine.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a></p>

<p>If, as I can but believe, this letter be spurious, none the less may it
serve to indicate how firmly the persuasion was fixed in the minds of the
Protestants that insidious designs were cherished against La Rochelle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Designs upon the city.</div>

<p>It was not long before those designs began to develop. Strozzi, to whom
the inhabitants had sent a deputation, avowedly to obtain explanations
respecting the circumstances of the massacre, but in reality to discover
the plans of the government, graciously offered some companies of his
soldiers for their protection. But the Rochellois with equal politeness
declined to accept such help. Meanwhile, they set themselves vigorously
at work, and not only organized the inhabitants and refugees into
companies for military defence, but repaired and manned the
fortifications, and introduced a great abundance of provisions and
munitions of war into the city.<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span> few days later, letters were
received from Charles himself, which, while endeavoring to calm the minds
of the inhabitants respecting recent occurrences, promised them full
protection in their religious rights, proclaimed the king's unaltered
determination to maintain his edict, and called upon them to receive with
due submission M. de Biron, whom he sent them to be their governor. No
better choice could have been made among the Roman Catholics; for Biron,
it was currently reported, so far from approving of severity, had himself
narrowly escaped being involved in the massacre, and had owed his safety
mainly to the fact that he was in command at the arsenal.</p>

<p>The shrewd Rochellois, however, while they greeted the king's assurances
with all outward show of credit, were not willing to be duped. They
listened respectfully to the king's envoys, and professed themselves his
most devoted subjects; but they begged to be excused from receiving
Marshal Biron as their governor until the troops of Strozzi should have
been removed from their dangerous proximity to the city, and until the
fleet should have set sail from Brouage. Nor, indeed, could Biron himself
obtain better conditions, when, having sought an interview with the
deputies of La Rochelle outside of the walls, he entreated them, with
sincere or well-feigned emotion, to forestall the ruin impending over
them.<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> In vain did he humor their claim, dating from regal
concessions and long prescription, that La Rochelle need receive no
garrison but of her own municipal militia.<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> In vain did he offer to
make his entry with but one or two followers, and promise that, when they
had duly submitted, he would secure them from injury at the hands of the
royal troops, and would relieve them of the presence of a fleet. The
citizens were inflexible. The experience of Castres, where lately the
credulous inhabitants had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>considerately admitted a governor sent them
by the king, and had paid for their folly with their lives, confirmed
them in the resolution rather to die with sword in hand than to be
slaughtered like sheep.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a></p>

<p>Two months (September and October) passed in fruitless
negotiations&mdash;precious time, which the citizens put to good service in
preparing for the inevitable struggle. It was not until the eighth of
November that the first skirmish took place, in which one of two royal
galleys sent to reconnoitre the situation of La Rochelle was captured and
brought into harbor by some Huguenot boats that had sailed out intending
to secure the neighboring Île de Ré for the Protestant cause.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mission of La Noue.</div>

<p>Meantime the court, reluctant to undertake an enterprise so formidable as
the regular siege of La Rochelle seemed likely to prove, resorted to
pacific measures, and resolved to employ for the purpose a person the
most unlikely to be selected by Roman Catholics. This was none other than
the famous François de la Noue, a Protestant leader not less remarkable
for generalship than for literary ability, of whose "Political and
Military Discourses," written during a later captivity, it has been said
with justice that, in perspicuity, force, and good judgment, they are not
inferior to the most celebrated commentaries of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> La Noue
was with Louis of Nassau in the city of Mons when the news of Admiral
Coligny's murder, and of the consequent failure of the promised support
of France, reached him. Mons soon after surrendered to the Duke of Alva,
and La Noue scarcely knew whither to turn for refuge, when he received
from his old friend, the Duke of Longueville, Governor of Picardy, a
cordial invitation to return to France. Not without many misgivings, he
visited Paris, where, contrary to his expectations, Charles greeted him
very graciously, and even restored to him the confiscated property of his
wife's murdered brother, Téligny. Taking advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>tage of the moment, the
king now requested La Noue to undertake the task of mediating between the
government and La Rochelle, and thus preventing the outbreak of a new
civil war and the effusion of more blood. At first La Noue positively
declined the appointment; but the king was urgent, and the arguments
which he adduced coincided with the Huguenot's own impressions of the
hopelessness of a struggle undertaken by a single city against the united
forces of the most powerful kingdom of Christendom. It was only after the
most solemn protestations of Charles, that he would not make use of him
as an instrument to deceive and ruin his Protestant brethren, that La
Noue reluctantly consented to accept a commission from which he was more
likely to reap embarrassment than glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is badly received by the Rochellois.</div>

<p>And certainly his first reception by the Rochellois was far from
flattering. In a conference with the deputies of the city, in the
suburban village of Tadon<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>&mdash;for La Noue was not permitted to enter
the walls&mdash;the burghers clearly revealed the suspicion with which they
viewed him. They bluntly told him, after listening to the propositions he
brought from the king, "that they had come to confer with M. de la Noue,
but that they did not recognize him in the person before them. The brave
warrior so closely bound to them in former years, and who had lost an arm
in their defence, had a different heart, never came to them with vain
hopes, nor, under the guise of friendship, invited them to conferences
destined only to betray them."<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> But, in spite of this somewhat
uncourteous reception, the well-known and trusted integrity of the great
Huguenot captain soon broke through the thin crust of coolness, which,
after all, was rather assumed than really felt. La Noue was suffered to
enter the city, and at the échevinage, or city hall, was permitted to lay
before the general assembly, or municipal government, as well as the
other citizens, the full extent of the king's concessions. Amnesty for
the past, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>firmation of the city's privileges, passports for any who
might wish to remove to England or Germany, safe return for those whom
fear had banished, free exercise of the Protestant religion in two
quarters of the city, with three ministers to be chosen by the people and
approved by the governor&mdash;all this he offered. On the other hand, a new
church must be built for the Roman Catholics, the strangers who had
lately come must remove elsewhere, and, of course, the governor must be
admitted, although the king kindly consented to let them designate any
other sufficiently distinguished and capable person, if they preferred to
do so.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The royal proposals rejected.</div>

<p>Neither the exposition of the terms of the royal clemency, nor the dark
picture drawn of the ruin overhanging the city, shook the constancy of
its brave advocates. They replied that they would consent to receive
neither garrison nor royal governor, and they exhibited to La Noue their
charters granted by Charles the Fifth, and ratified both by Louis the
Eleventh and by the reigning monarch. They added, "that, with God's help,
they hoped not to be caught in their beds as their brethren had been at
the Parisian matins."<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> Yet, even after this conference, the
Rochellois were so far from losing their respect for La Noue, that they
made him three propositions: either he might remain in La Rochelle as a
private citizen; or he might assume the military command, as their
commander-in-chief; or, if he should prefer so to do, he might pass over
into England in one of their vessels. La Noue went to consult with
Marshal Biron and others, and shortly returned. With their full
concurrence he accepted the military command&mdash;the unparalleled anomaly
being thus exhibited of a general of great experience and high reputation
voluntarily given by the besiegers to the besieged, because of the
confidence they entertained that by his moderation and pacific
inclination he would restrain the excesses of the mob and hasten the
return of peace.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning of the fourth religious war.</div>

<p>And now the siege, which the court had long hesitated to undertake, began
in earnest. On the fourth of December, Marshal Biron approached La
Rochelle with seven ensigns of horse and eighteen companies of foot, and
two larger cannon.<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> Meantime the most strenuous efforts were put
forth to collect an adequate besieging force. When milder measures failed
to secure prompt obedience, recourse was had to threats, and the nobles
were summoned on pain, in case of disobedience, of losing their
privileges, and being reduced to the rank of "roturiers." The menace had
its effect, and in the month of January, 1573, the force under Biron had
swollen to sixty companies of foot, with not less than thirty-seven large
cannon&mdash;a considerable provision of artillery for that period.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of La Rochelle.</div>

<p>The city of La Rochelle occupies the head of a deep bay, stretching in a
north-easterly direction from the ocean, and serving at present as the
large and convenient harbor for its extensive commerce. The old town,
whose origin is lost in the mists of antiquity, covered only a small part
of the area since inclosed by walls. A narrow peninsula, protected on the
one side by a sheet of water and on the other by marshes, offered a
tempting site, and was first occupied. The larger inlet on the west was
the old, and probably for a long time the only haven; but long before the
middle of the sixteenth century the action of the tide, which washes in
great quantities of sand, combining with the gradual deposit of alluvium
made by the neighboring springs, had converted this inlet into a
marsh&mdash;"les Marais Salans"&mdash;intersected by ditches and used only in the
manufacture of salt. The marsh itself has since been entirely reclaimed.
The "new" harbor, as the smaller inlet was still called, at the period of
which I am speaking, was of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span> inferior capacity, and was included
within the circuit of the walls.<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> A chain, extended between the two
towers guarding its narrow entrance, effectually precluded the passage of
hostile vessels.</p>

<p>For considerably more than one-half of their circuit, the walls of La
Rochelle were inaccessible to the land forces; and the deep foss skirting
them was full of water, except on the north and north-east. The
fortifications, everywhere formidable, had, therefore, been constructed
with extraordinary care in these directions; for it was here that the
brunt of the attack must be borne. With Puritan simplicity and faith, the
reformed inhabitants of La Rochelle had named the strong work at the
northwestern angle of the circuit the "Bastion de l'Évangile," or the
"Bastion of the Gospel." It was appropriately supported on the right by
the "Cavalier de l'Épître." Other forts, such as that of Cognes at the
north-eastern angle, were but little inferior in importance; it was
evident, however, that upon the ability of the Rochellois to defend the
Bastion de l'Évangile must depend the salvation of the city.<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Resoluteness of the Rochellois.</div>

<p>But the chief strength of the city was to be found in the manly
resolution of the inhabitants to secure for themselves and their children
the right to worship God according to the purer faith, or perish in the
attempt. An incident occurring about this time served to illustrate and
to confirm their courage. A short distance in advance of the Bastion de
l'Évangile there stood a solitary windmill, which, on account of its
advantageous position, the Rochellois were anxious to retain. The captain
to whose guard it was intrusted, recognizing the ease with which he might
be surprised and cut off, took the precaution to draw off at dusk the
small detachment which he had placed there by day, leaving but a single
soldier to act as sentry. Meantime, Strozzi had determined to capture the
mill. This he attempted to do, taking advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span> a moonlight night. To
the two culverines brought to play upon him, the solitary defender could
answer only with his arquebuse; but so briskly did he fire, and so well
did he counterfeit the voices of others, that the assailants believed an
entire company to be present. At last, when he no longer could hold out,
the soldier only surrendered after stipulating for the life of himself
and his entire band. Notwithstanding his promise, Strozzi, when once his
astonishment at the appearance of the single actor who had played so many
parts had given place to anger at the deceit practised upon him, was in
favor of hanging the Huguenot for his audacity. But Biron would only
consent to have him sent to the galleys, a punishment which he escaped by
finding means to slip away from the hands of the royalists.<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Their military strength.</div>

<p>The entire military force of the besieged comprised about thirteen
hundred regular troops, besides two thousand citizens, well armed and
drilled, and under competent captains. There was an abundance of powder,
of wine, biscuit, and other provisions, although of wheat there was but
little.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> Meantime assistance was anxiously expected from England,
and the courage of the common people, incited by the exhortations of the
ministers, did not flag, notwithstanding the feebler spirit of the rich
and the actual desertion of a few leaders.<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a></p>

<p>The besiegers were not idle. Besides occupying positions north, east, and
south of the city, which effectually cut off communication from the land
side, they built forts on opposite sides of the outer harbor, and
stranded at the entrance a large carack, which was made firm in its
position with stones and sand. The work, when provided with guns and
troops, commanded the passage, and was christened "le Fort de
l'Aiguille." In vain did the Rochellois attempt to destroy or capture it;
the carack, while it proved unavailing to prevent the entrance of an
occasional vessel laden with grain or ammunition, remained the most
formidable point in the possession of the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry, Duke of Anjou, appointed to conduct the siege.</div>

<p>In order to give her favorite son a new opportunity to acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span> military
distinction, the queen mother now persuaded Charles to permit the Duke of
Anjou to conduct the siege. He arrived before La Rochelle about the
middle of February,<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> with a brilliant train of princes and nobles,
among whom were Alençon, Guise, Aumale, and Montluc, besides Henry of
Navarre and his cousin Condé, who, as they had to sustain the rôle of
good Roman Catholics, could scarcely avoid taking part in the campaign
against their former brethren. In the ordinances soon after published by
Anjou, he seems to have hoped to weaken the Huguenots by copying their
own strictness of moral discipline. The very Catholic practice of profane
swearing, in which his Majesty was so proficient, was prohibited on pain
of severe punishment; and it was prescribed that a sermon should daily be
preached in the camp.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> A good round oath none the less continued to
be received by the soldiers, in all doubtful cases, as a sufficient proof
of loyalty to Mother Church, nor did they cease because of the ordinance
from ridiculing the idea that such good Christians as they needed
preaching, which was well enough for unevangelized pagans.<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The besieged pray and fight.</div>

<p>In view of the impending peril, the Protestants had recourse, as their
custom was, to prayer and fasting. The sixteenth and eighteenth of
February were days of public humiliation. From their knees the Huguenots
went with redoubled courage to the ramparts. The crisis had at length
arrived. A series of furious assaults were given, directed principally
against the northern wall and the Bastion de l'Évangile. It was in one of
these attacks, on the third of March, that the Duke of Aumale was killed.
By the besieged the death of so eminent a member of the house of Lorraine
was interpreted as a signal judgment of God upon the most cruel member of
a persecuting family&mdash;another presage that the sword should never depart
from the princely stock which had begun the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span> until it should be
altogether destroyed. The royalists, on the other hand, found in it a
great source of regret; while Catharine, terrified at the danger to which
her son might be exposed, wrote one of her ill-spelt letters to
Montpensier, entreating him and the other veterans not to suffer any of
the princes to go imprudently near the walls.<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bravery of the women.</div>

<p>It does not enter into the plan of this history to detail the progress of
the siege. Let it suffice to say that the enemy was met at every point
and repulsed. Not content with simply defending their walls, the
Huguenots made sorties, in which many of Anjou's followers were slain.
Sometimes dressing in the uniform of those they had killed or taken
prisoners, they returned and penetrated into the hostile camp, learned
the plans of the assailants, and cut off more than one man of note. The
presence of women among them became an element of strength; for these,
surmounting the weakness of their sex, did good service in the mines, or,
donning armor, defended the breach and drove the enemy into the
ditch.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> It was remarked that, as the supply of fresh provisions
diminished, the lack was in some degree compensated by such an abundance
of cockles on the sands as had never before been known. If the
Protestants regarded this incident as a providential interposition in
their behalf,<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> the Roman Catholics sought to account for it by
supposing that the operations of the siege had permitted the fish to
multiply undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> However this might be, the women of La
Rochelle sallied forth to hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>band this new resource; but their
imprudence in straying beyond the range of the guns was rewarded with
insolent outrage on the part of such of the enemy as were in the
vicinity. Even this circumstance the Huguenots knew how to turn to
advantage. Disguising themselves in feminine attire, a troop of Huguenot
soldiers, a day or two later, issued from the city when the tide was out,
apparently bent on the same errand. It was not long before the royalists
undertook to repeat a diversion which seemed to offer little danger to
them. Scarcely, however, had they approached when the clumsy costume was

his temerity with his life.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">La Noue retires. Failure of diplomacy.</div>

<p>The ordinary wiles of Catharine were not left untried; but she effected
little or nothing by negotiation. The people were not so easily cajoled
and duped as their leaders had often been, and would accept no terms
except such as the court utterly refused to offer&mdash;the restoration of the
privileges conferred by the edict, its confirmation by oath, and the
interchange of hostages, to be kept in some neutral state in Germany,
with entire liberty of worship and exemption from royal garrison in and
around La Rochelle, Montauban, Nismes, and Sancerre.<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> Even François
de la Noue became impatient at the excessive caution which the Huguenots
seemed to him to display, and, redeeming the promise he had given the
king before he took command, retired from the city (on the eleventh of
March) when all hope of reconciliation had apparently disappeared. With
wonderful prudence he had managed to forfeit the confidence of neither
party. Yet on some occasions, it must be admitted, his self-control was
sorely tried. For example, at one time a minister&mdash;not long after deposed
from the sacred office&mdash;so far forgot himself in the heat of angry
discussion as to give La Noue a sound box upon the ear. Even then the
great captain refused to order the offender's punishment, and confined
himself to sending him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span> under guard, to his wife, with directions to

<div class="sidenote">English aid miscarries.</div>

<p>The assistance which La Rochelle had counted upon receiving from England
never came. Count Montgomery was a skilful negotiator. If he was unable
to prevail upon Elizabeth to give open countenance to the Huguenots, on
account of the league recently entered into, which Retz had been
specially sent by Charles to confirm, he at least succeeded in obtaining
a sum of forty thousand francs from various English, French, and Flemish
sympathizers, with which he was permitted, notwithstanding protests from
Paris, to fit out a fleet. Elizabeth, indeed, so far overcame her
scruples as to allow a large vessel of her own to follow. But when
Montgomery's squadron reached the roads of La Rochelle, the fifty-three
ships of which it was composed, and which carried eighteen hundred or two
thousand men, were so small and badly-appointed&mdash;in short, so inferior in
strength to the fewer vessels of the king standing off the entrance&mdash;that
they avoided coming to close quarters, stood off to Belle Isle, and
finally returned to England. Queen Elizabeth, at all times very doubtful
respecting the propriety of assisting subjects against their monarch, had
meantime disowned the enterprise as piratical, and expressed the hope the
culprits might be destroyed. It was not, in this case, merely her
customary dissimulation. The plundering by some French and Netherland
sailors of the vessel on which the Earl of Worcester was proceeding, in
the queen's name, to stand as sponsor at the baptism of Charles's infant
daughter, had greatly incensed her.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> Not, however, that Elizabeth
lost any of that remarkable interest which she had always taken in Count
Montgomery, or felt at all inclined to give him up to the French
government for his breach of the peace. For when, a little later, a
demand was made for the culprit, she assured the ambassador of Charles
that she could swear she was ignorant that the count was in her
dominions. "But," she added, "were he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span> to come, I would answer your
master as his father answered my sister, Queen Mary, when he said, 'I
will not consent to be the hangman of the Queen of England.' So his
Majesty, the King of France, must excuse me if I can no more act as
executioner of those of my religion than King Henry would discharge a
similar office in the case of those that were not of his religion."<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a></p>

<p>In other parts of France it had fared no better with the attempt to crush
the Huguenots. Montauban and Nismes still held out. Various places in the
south-east fell into Huguenot hands. The siege of Sommières, near Nismes,
by the Roman Catholics, was so obstinate, and the garrison capitulated on
such favorable terms, that the Protestants were rather elated than
discouraged. Marshal Damville had assailed it only in order to save his
credit, and the little town detained him nearly two months,&mdash;from the
eleventh of February to the ninth of April. Every device was employed to
retard his success. Streams of boiling oil were poured upon the heads of
the assailants, and red-hot hoops of iron were dexterously tossed over
their shoulders. In the end the garrison marched out with all the honors
of war.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> The Huguenots surprised Villeneuve, near the Rhône, by
effecting an entrance, much as they had entered Nismes in 1569, through
the grated opening by which the waters of a sewer issued from the
walls.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning of the siege of Sancerre.</div>

<p>But it was Sancerre which, next to La Rochelle, occasioned the court the
greatest annoyance, both because of its central position<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> and
because of its comparative proximity to Paris. Here the Protestants of
Berry and the adjacent provinces had found a welcome refuge. Citizens and
refugees refused to admit a royal garrison, and foiled the attempt to
capture the place by escalade. Treachery was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span> work, and, as usual, it
was most rife among the richer class. By their connivance the citadel or
castle was surprised by the troops sent by the governor of the province,
M. de la Chastre; but it was retaken on the same day.<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>
Notwithstanding this warning, the people of Sancerre took none of the
precautions which their situation demanded, apparently unable to believe
that, when such a city as La Rochelle was in revolt, the king would
undertake to subdue so small a place as Sancerre. There were no stores of
provisions, and the buildings in proximity to the walls, from which an
enemy could incommode the city, had not been torn down, when, between the
third and ninth of January, 1573, a force of five thousand foot and five
hundred horse, under La Chastre, besides many nobles and gentlemen of the
vicinage, made its appearance before the walls. The inhabitants now
discovered their capital mistakes, but it was too late to remedy them.
Hunger began almost immediately to make itself felt, while the places
they had neglected to destroy or preoccupy proved very convenient to the
royalists for the next two or three months, during which it was attempted
to take Sancerre by assault. Yet the direct attack proved a failure, and,
on the twentieth of March, the siege was changed to a blockade. Forts
were erected in the most advantageous spots, and a wide trench was dug
around the entire city.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> Sancerre was to be tried by the severe
ordeal of hunger; and certainly the most frightful among ancient sieges

city.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The incipient famine.</div>

<p>Did not the sufferings of the heroic inhabitants claim our sympathy, we
might read with entertainment the singular devices they resorted to in
grappling with a terrible foe whose insidious advances were more
difficult to oppose than the open assaults of the enemy. For the famine
of Sancerre boasts of a historian more copious and minute than Josephus
or Livy. In reading the narrative of the famous Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span> de Léry<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>&mdash;the
same writer to whom we are indebted for an authentic account of
Villegagnon's unfortunate scheme of American colonization&mdash;we seem to be
perusing a great pathological treatise. Never was physician more watchful
of his patient's symptoms than Léry with his hand upon the pulse of
famishing Sancerre. It would almost seem that the restless Huguenot, who
united in his own person the opposite qualifications of clergyman and
soldier, desired to make his little work a useful guide in similar
circumstances, for a portion of it, at least, has been appropriately
styled "a cookery book for the besieged."<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a></p>

<p>Early in the siege, not without some qualms, the inhabitants made trial
of the flesh of a horse accidentally killed. Next an ass, and then the
mules, of which there was a considerable number, were brought to the
shambles. The butchers were now ordered to sell this new kind of meat,
and a maximum price was fixed. For a fortnight the supply of cats held
out, after which rats and mice became the chief staple of food. Dog-flesh
was next reluctantly tasted, and found, as our conscientious chronicler
observes, to be somewhat sweet and insipid.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> And so the spring of
1573 passed away, and summer came; but no succor arrived for the
beleaguered city. On the contrary, there came the disheartening tidings
from the west that a peace had been concluded by the Huguenots of La
Rochelle, in which no mention was made of Sancerre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Losses of the royal army before La Rochelle.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Roman Catholic processions.</div>

<p>So successful had been the defence of the citadel of Protestantism on the
shores of the ocean, so unexpectedly large the royal losses, that the
court was only waiting for a decent pretext to abandon the unfortunate
siege. Pestilence added its victims to those of the sword, and it was
currently reported that forty thousand of the be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>siegers were swept away
by their combined assaults.<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> A more careful enumeration, however,
shows that, while the Rochellois, out of thirty-one hundred soldiers,
lost thirteen hundred, including twenty-eight "pairs," the king, out of a
little more than forty thousand troops, had lost twenty-two thousand, ten
thousand of whom died in the breach or in engagements elsewhere. Nor was
the loss of officers trifling; two hundred had died, including fifty of
great distinction, and five "maîtres de camp."<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> And, with all this
expenditure of life, and with the heavy drafts upon the public treasure,
little or nothing had been accomplished. Meanwhile, in other parts of
France there existed a scarcity of food amounting almost to a famine; nor
had the solemn processions to the shrines of the saints&mdash;processions for
the most part rendered contemptible by the irreverent conduct both of the
clergymen and the laity that took part in them<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>&mdash;averted the wrath
of heaven. The poor suffered extremely. Selfishness gained such
ascendancy in some towns, that cruel ruses were adopted to remove the
destitute that had taken refuge within their walls. It was not strange
that the extraordinary mortality which soon fell upon the well-to-do
burghers was viewed by many as a direct punishment sent by the
Almighty.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Election of Henry of Anjou to the crown of Poland.</div>

<p>The event which came just in time to free the court from its
embarrassment was the election of Henry of Anjou to the vacant throne of
Poland. We have already witnessed the perplexity of Bishop Montluc when
the tidings of the massacre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span> first reached him.<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> If he could have
denied its reality, he would have done so. This being impossible, he was
forced to content himself with misrepresenting the origin of the
slaughter, slandering the admiral and the other victims, and circulating
the calumnies of Charpentier and others who prated about a Huguenot
conspiracy. A judicious distribution of French gold assisted his own
eloquent sophistry; and the Duke of Anjou, portrayed as a chivalric
prince and one who was not ill-affected to religious liberty, was chosen
king over his formidable rivals. Charles and Catharine were alike
delighted. The former could scarcely find words to express his joy<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>
at the prospect of being freed from the presence of a brother whom he
feared, and perhaps hated; while the queen mother's gratification was
even more intense at the peaceful solution of the prophecy of
Nostradamus, than at the elevation of her favorite son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edict of Pacification, Boulogne, July, 1573.</div>

<p>The peace between the king and the Rochellois was concluded in June, and
was formally promulgated in July, 1573, in a royal edict from Boulogne.
The chief provision was that the Protestants in the cities of La
Rochelle, Montauban, and Nismes should enjoy entire freedom of public
worship, while their brethren throughout the kingdom should have liberty
of conscience and the right to sell their property and remove wherever
they might choose, whether within or without the realm. Only gentlemen
and others enjoying high jurisdiction, who had remained constant in their
faith, and had taken up arms with the three cities, were to be allowed to
collect their friends to the number of ten to witness their marriages and
baptisms, according to the custom of the Reformed Church. Even this
privilege could not be exercised within the distance of two leagues from
the royal court or from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span> the city of Paris; nor did the edict confer the
right to preach or celebrate the Lord's Supper.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> La Rochelle,
Nismes, and Montauban gained their point, and were to be exempted from
receiving garrisons or having citadels built, with the condition that
they should for two years constantly keep four of their principal
citizens at court as pledges of their fidelity. All promises of
abjuration were declared null and void. Amnesty was proclaimed, and, to
cap the climax of absurdity, the brave Huguenots who had defended their
homes for months against Charles were solemnly declared to be held the
king's "good, loyal, and faithful subjects and servants."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meagre results of the war.</div>

<p>The results of the war on the king's side were certainly very meagre. To
have fought for the greater part of a year with the miserable Huguenots
that had escaped the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, and then to
conclude the war by such a peace, was certainly ignominious enough for
Charles and his mother. For the Huguenot party was now, more than ever, a
recognized power in the state, with three strongholds&mdash;one in the west
and two in the south. Into no one of these could a royal garrison be
introduced. La Rochelle, in particular, having repulsed every assault of
the best army that could be brought against it, was acknowledged
invincible by the exemptions accorded to it in common with Nismes and
Montauban. It was hardly by such expectations that Charles had been
prevailed upon to throw down the gage of war to his subjects of the
reformed faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The siege and famine of Sancerre continue.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Sancerre, not even named in the
edict,<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> had been sustained under appalling difficulties by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
confident hope of assistance from the south. But the hope was long
deferred, and they grew sick at heart. The prospect was already dark
enough, when, on the second of June, a Protestant soldier, who had made
his way into the city through the enemy's lines, brought the depressing
announcement that no aid must be expected from Languedoc for six weeks.
As but little wheat remained in Sancerre, the immediate effect of the
intelligence was that liberty was given to some seventy of the poor to
leave the city walls. At the same time the daily ration was limited to
half a pound of grain. A week later it was reduced to one-quarter of a
pound. Not long after only a single pound was doled out once a week, and
by the end of the month the supply entirely gave out. The beginning of
July reduced the besieged to the necessity of tasking their ingenuity to
make palatable food of the hides of cattle, next of the skins of horses,
dogs, and asses. The stock of even this unsavory material soon became
exhausted; whereupon, not very unnaturally, parchment was turned to good
account. Manuscripts a good century old were eaten with relish. Soaked
for a couple of days in water, and afterward boiled as much longer, when
they became glutinous they were fried, like tripe, or prepared with herbs
and spices, after the manner of a hodge-podge. The writer who is our
authority for these culinary details, informs us that he had seen the
dish devoured with eagerness while the original letters written upon the
parchment were still legible.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> But the urgent necessities of their
situation did not suffer the half-famished inhabitants to stop here. With
the proverbial ingenuity of their nation, they turned their attention to
the parchment on old drums, and subjected to the skilful hands of cooks
the discarded hoofs, horns, and bones of animals, the harness of horses,
and even refuse scraps of leather. There seemed to be nothing they could
not lay under contribution to furnish at least a little nutriment.</p>

<p>And yet ghastly hunger little by little tightened her relentless embrace.
Almost all the children under twelve years of age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span> died. In the universal
reign of famine there were at last found those who were ready to repeat
the horrible crime of feeding upon the flesh of their own kindred. It was
discovered that a husband and wife, with a neighboring crone, had
endeavored to satisfy the gnawings of hunger by eating a newly dead
child. Their guilt came speedily to light, and was punished according to
the severe code of the sixteenth century. The father was sentenced by the
council to be burned alive; his wife to be strangled and her body
consigned to the flames; while the corpse of the old woman who had
instigated the foul deed but had meanwhile died, was ordered to be dug up
and burned. But the feeling of the great majority of the besieged was far
removed from that despair which prompts to an inhuman disregard of
natural decency and affection. Near the close of July a boy of barely ten
years, as he lay on his death-bed, said to his weeping parents: "Why do
you weep thus at seeing me die of hunger? I do not ask bread, mother; I
know you have none. But since God wills that I die thus, we must accept
it cheerfully. Was not that holy man Lazarus hungry? Have I not so read
in the Bible?"<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a></p>

<p>The catastrophe could not much longer be deferred. Within the city speedy
death stared every man in the face. Permission had, we have seen, been
accorded to the poor, early in June, to go forth from the city walls; but
the besieging force had mercilessly driven them back when they attempted
to gain the open country. Numbers, unwilling to accept a second time the
fatal hospitality of the city, preferred to remain in their exposed
situation, miserably dragging out a precarious existence by subsisting
upon snails, buds of trees and shrubs&mdash;even to the very grass of the
field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sancerre capitulates.</div>

<p>Happily for Sancerre, the political exigencies of the royal court insured
for the besieged Protestants, in the inevitable capitulation, more
favorable terms than they might otherwise have obtained. As early as the
eighteenth of July, Léry had been informed at a parley, by a former
acquaintance on the Roman Catholic side, that a general peace had been
concluded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span> and that Henry of Anjou had been elected to the throne of
Poland. This first intimation was discredited by the cautious
Protestants, not unused to the wiles of the enemy. But when, some twenty
days later (on the sixth of August), the statement was confirmed, and the
Sancerrois received the additional assurance that they would be mildly
treated, their surprise knew no bounds. The terms of surrender were
easily arranged. A ransom of forty thousand livres was to be exacted from
the city. On the thirty-first of August, M. de la Chastre made his solemn
entry into Sancerre, accompanied by a band of Roman Catholic priests
chanting a <i>Te Deum</i> over his success. As was too frequently the case,
the promise of immunity to the inhabitants was but poorly kept. Scarcely
had two weeks passed before the "bailli" Johanneau,<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> summoned from
his house by the archers of the prévôt, on the plea that M. de la Chastre
desired his presence, was treacherously murdered on the way to the
governor's house. Besides assassination, other infractions of the
capitulation were committed; the gates of the city were burned, the walls
dismantled, many of the houses torn down. In fact, so unmercifully was
Sancerre harried, partly by the troops, partly by the peasantry of the
neighborhood, and by the "bailli" of Berry, that the reformed church of
this place seems to have been, for the time, completely dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended a siege which had lasted some eight months. The besieged had
lost only eighty-four men by the direct effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span> of warfare; but more
than five hundred persons perished during the last six weeks of sheer
starvation.<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a></p>

<p>Sancerre owed its release from the horrors of the siege in great part to
the same causes that had powerfully contributed to the conclusion of the
peace. The Polish ambassadors, coming to proffer the crown to the king's
brother, Henry of Anjou, were about to reach the French court. They were
already not a little surprised at the discovery that the statements and
promises made in the king's name by that not over-scrupulous negotiator,
Montluc, Bishop of Valence, were impudent impostures, fabricated for no
other purpose than to secure at all hazards the success of the French
candidate for the Polish throne. To exhibit to them at this critical
juncture the edifying spectacle of a royal governor of the province of
Berry engaged in the reduction of a city the only crime of which was its
desire to enjoy religious liberty&mdash;this would have been a dangerous
venture. Consequently it was no fortuitous coincidence that Sancerre
capitulated the very day the Polish ambassadors made their appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reception of the Polish ambassadors.</div>

<p>We shall not dwell upon the pomp attending their reception. The banquet
held in the new palace of the Tuileries was brilliant. In the pageant
succeeding it was displayed a massive rock of silver, with sixteen nymphs
in as many niches, personating the provinces of the French kingdom. When,
after some verses well sung but indifferently composed, these nymphs
descended from their elevation, and took part in an intricate maze of
dance, the Polish spectators remarked, in the excess of their admiration,
that the French ballet was something that could be imitated by none of
the kings of the earth. "I would rather," dryly adds a contemporary
historian, "that they had said as much respecting our <i>armies</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Discontent of the south with the terms of peace.</div>

<p>The Protestants of Southern France had been included in the Edict of
Pacification. In fact, Nismes and Montauban were as distinctly referred
to by name as La Rochelle.<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> But the terms of peace were not to the
taste of the enterprising and self-reliant Huguenots of Languedoc and
Guyenne. They had learned, during the last ten years, to distrust all
assurances emanating from the court, even when claiming the authority of
the king's name. Experience had taught them that previous edicts were

failed to destroy.<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> Without, therefore, either definitely accepting
or rejecting the terms offered them, the Protestants of Nismes applied to
Marshal Damville, who, at the conclusion of the peace, found himself with
the royal troops at the hamlet of Milhaud, a league or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span> two from their
gates,<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> for a fortnight's suspension of hostilities. The request
being granted, a truce was established which was extended by successive
prolongations beyond the beginning of the next year.<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Assembly of Milhau and Montauban.</div>

<p>Meantime the Protestants, notified by the Duke of Anjou of the conclusion
of the peace, sent messengers to his camp requesting that as the matter
was one vitally affecting the entire Protestant population, they might
receive permission to meet, under protection of the royal authority, and
deliberate respecting it. The king's consent having been obtained,
Protestant deputies from almost all parts of the kingdom came together,
late in the month of August, 1573, in the city of Milhau-en-Rouergue,
from which they shortly transferred their sessions to Montauban.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military organization of the Huguenots.</div>

<p>This important assembly resolved to accept no peace unless based upon
equitable terms and secured by ample guarantees. In view of the
possibility of the recurrence of war, provision was made for a complete
military organization of the Huguenot resources in the south of France.
For this purpose Languedoc was divided into two "généralités" or
governments&mdash;the government of Nismes, or Lower Languedoc, placed under
command of M. de Saint Romain, and that of Upper Languedoc, with
Montauban for its chief city, to which the Viscount de Paulin was
assigned as military chief. Both governments were in turn subdivided into
dioceses or particular governments, each furnished with a governor and a
deliberative assembly. It was provided that in Nismes and Montauban
respectively a council should be convened consisting of deputies from all
the dioceses of the government, and that to this council, together with
the governor, should be intrusted the administration of the finances,
with authority to impose taxes alike upon Protestants and Roman
Catholics. The organization, it was estimated, could readily place twenty
thousand men in the field.<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the first attempts to perfect a system of warfare forced upon
the Huguenots by the treacherous assaults of their enemies&mdash;a fatal
necessity of instituting a state within a state, foreboding nothing but
ruin to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Petition to the king.</div>

<p>One of the chief results of the deliberations at Montauban was the
preparation of a petition to be laid before the king. This paper, which
has come down to us with the signatures of the viscounts, barons, and
other adherents of the Huguenot party, was intended to be an expression
not only of their own individual views, but also of the sentiments of the
churches they represented.<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> The language is sharp and incisive, the
demands are unmistakably bold. For a sufficient justification of their
recent words and actions, the Huguenots of Guyenne point the monarch to
his own letter of the twenty-fourth of August, 1572, by which constraint
was laid upon them to assume arms. They call upon Charles, in accordance
with the promise contained in that letter, to follow up the traces there
alleged to have been found regarding the murder of Gaspard de Coligny, to
appoint impartial judges for this purpose, and to execute exemplary
justice upon the guilty. Not satisfied with claiming the annulling of all
judicial proceedings, the destruction of all monuments erected to
perpetuate the memory of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, and the
abolition of processions instituted by the parliaments of Paris and
Toulouse with the same end in view, they call on Charles to make a
dec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>laration "that justly and for good reasons have 'those of the
religion' taken arms, resisting and warring in these last troubles, as
constrained thereto by the violent acts with which they have been
assailed and driven to distraction." They next demand those concessions
which alone can make the position of the Protestants in France secure and
endurable&mdash;freedom of worship and church discipline established by
perpetual provision, irrespective of place or time; the right of
honorable burial; immunity from taxation for the support of Roman
Catholic ceremonies; admission to schools and colleges; just regulations
as to marriage; amnesty; the power to hold civil office, etc. They
request permission to levy a sum of one hundred and twenty thousand
livres among themselves to pay off the indebtedness incurred by them in
past wars. And they go so far as not only to stipulate that the King of
France shall renounce all leagues he may have contracted with the enemies
of his Protestant subjects for their destruction, but even to propose
that he shall conclude a defensive alliance with the Protestant states of
Germany, Switzerland, England, and Scotland. Meanwhile, in order to
prevent the recurrence of "a conspiracy and Sicilian Vespers," of which
the Huguenots would be the victims, they ask to be permitted to hold
forever the guard of those cities which they now have in their
possession, and in addition some other cities in each of the provinces of
the realm. The Protestant cities, it is stipulated, shall retain their
walls and munitions, and the royal governors shall enter them accompanied
only by a small retinue. The observance of these articles the Huguenots
insist shall be solemnly sworn in privy and public council, and by the
inhabitants of all places, the oath to be renewed every five years.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>Such stout demands did the Protestants of the south and south-west
address to Charles the Ninth on the first anniversary of the fatal matins
of Paris. They were, it must be admitted, somewhat different from what
might have been expected, a brief year before, from the fugitives who
made their escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span> from the bloody sword of their enemies. Moreover, the
terms laid down by the Huguenots of Lower Languedoc and Nismes were
conceived in the same brave language, and their demands were virtually
identical. Huguenot troops, paid by the king, to garrison both the cities
now in the hands of the Protestants, and two cities in each of the
sixteen provinces required for additional protection; free worship
irrespective of place; new parliaments in all the provinces, with
Protestant judges to administer justice to Protestants; liberty to levy
tithes for the support of reformed churches; punishment of the
instigators and perpetrators of the atrocities of the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew's Day, as robbers and disturbers of the public peace.<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>
The Tiers État of Provence and Dauphiny added to the demands of Languedoc
and Guyenne an urgent petition in favor of the reduction of the onerous
imposts under which the country was groaning.<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">"Les fronts d'airain."</div>

<div class="sidenote">Catharine's bitter reply.</div>

<p>The bearers of these demands were well able to give them forcible and
fearless enunciation&mdash;Yolet, Philippi, Chavagnac, and others of the men
known by the expressive designation of "Les fronts d'airain."<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a>
Assuredly a brow of brass was not out of place, when the Protestant
deputies, after a delay of some weeks, were reluctantly admitted to an
audience. Charles the Ninth and his court were at this time at
Villers-Cotterets, on their way to the eastern frontiers of France,
accompanying the newly elected King of Poland as he slowly and
unwillingly journeyed toward the capital of a kingdom regarded by him in
the light of a detestable place of exile. Contemporary writers inform us
that Yolet and his companions were in no degree overawed by the splendor
of the scene, and made no weak abatement in the terms they had been
instructed to propose. Charles heard them through with patient attention.
He was not a little astonished at the extent of their demands, we may be
certain; but he made no comment upon the courageous assertion of
Protestant rights. Not so with the queen mother. When the deputies had at
length finished their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span> harangue, Catharine could no longer contain her
indignation. "Why," she exclaimed with marked bitterness of tone, "if
your Condé himself were alive and in the heart of the kingdom with twenty
thousand horse and fifty thousand foot, and held the chief cities in his
power, he would not make half so great demands!"<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenots firm.</div>

<p>Despite the unwelcome character of the claims of the Huguenot deputies,
some answer must be given. It was found impossible to induce the envoys
to modify them. They denied that they had the power, even if they had the
inclination, to alter the action of those who had sent them. They were
therefore dismissed with expressions of good-will and the assurance that
two royal commissioners, the Duc d'Uzès and the Chevalier de Caylus,
would be sent to treat with the delegates whom the Huguenots might
choose. Marshal Damville, governor of the province, was to participate in
the negotiations and to appoint some city in the vicinity of Montauban
where they might be held. Charles was to hear the result of their
conference on his return from the German borders. Meanwhile he promised
to instruct Damville to put an end to all hostilities, provided the
Huguenots should desist from everything tending to provoke
retaliation.<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> The Tiers État received the answer to their petition
more promptly. It was naturally to the effect that a return to the meagre
scale of imposts under Louis XI. was utterly impracticable, in view of
the burdens of the treasury arising from recent wars and the pensions
yearly payable to various members of the royal family.<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress of the court to the borders of France.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Decline of the health of Charles IX.</div>

<p>It would be out of place to describe here at any length the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span> slow
progress of the French court as it escorted the King of Poland to the
borders of the realm. To none of the principal personages taking part was
it the occasion of much satisfaction. Catharine was as reluctant to part
from Henry, her favorite son, as he was himself averse to exchange the
pleasures of the Louvre and Saint Germain for the crown of an unruly and
half-civilized kingdom. As for Charles, the gratification he could not
conceal at the prospect of being soon freed from the presence of a
brother whom he both disliked and feared was more than counterbalanced by
the rapid decline of his own health. The boy of eleven, whom the Venetian
ambassador had described about the time of his accession to the throne as
handsome, amiable, and graceful in appearance, quick, vivacious, and
humane&mdash;in short, as possessing every quality from which a great prince
and a great king might be expected,<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> was now a man of twenty-three.
But his constitution, never robust, had gained nothing. The violent
exercises to which he had been addicted even as a child, and which,
though princely, had been pronounced dangerous by the ambassador, had
been incessantly practised&mdash;the ball, horsemanship, arms&mdash;and bodily
feebleness, not strength, had been the result. Other excesses had
contributed to hasten the catastrophe. More than all, if we may believe
the testimony of those who were familiar with the young monarch's later
life, the mental and moral experience of the last eighteen months left
their impress on his physical system. Charles, with the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew's Day, had lost all the elasticity of youth. Remorse for
complicity in the crime then perpetrated co-operated with the persuasion
of the uselessness and complete failure of the attempt to exterminate the
Huguenots, and the consciousness of having incurred the indelible mark of
hatred and detestation of an impartial posterity. Even in his sleeping
hours the curse of the murdered victims pursued him and disturbed his
rest. Neither by day nor by night could he banish the remembrance of the
time when blood ran so freely in the streets of Paris. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span></p>

<p>No attentive observer could doubt that the end was drawing near. The
court had gone no farther on its way to Lorraine than the little town of
Vitry-le-Français, on the river Marne, when Charles fell so seriously ill
as to be unable to prosecute his journey. As was usual in such cases,
while the physicians alleged as a sufficient explanation of the attack
the king's immoderate exercise in the chase and in blowing the trumpet,
the more suspicious frequenters of the court and the credulous people did
not hesitate to invent the story that he had been poisoned. But by whom
the crime had been committed was not settled. Some ascribed it to
Catharine, others to Henry of Anjou, while others still laid the guilt at
the door of a person of less note, whose honor the licentious king had
offended.<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Project of an English match renewed.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, neither the monarch's feeble health, nor the journeying of the
court, interrupted the prosecution of those diplomatic intrigues from
which Catharine still looked for valuable results. The election of Henry
to the Polish crown left but one of her sons upon whom the regal dignity
had not been conferred. The prophecy of Nostradamus might have its
complete fulfilment if only a kingdom could be found for Alençon.<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>
Otherwise the superstitious queen mother did not doubt that she was fated
to see not only Charles, but Henry also die, to make place for her
youngest child on the throne of France. La Mothe Fénélon was therefore
instructed to put forth every exertion to bring Queen Elizabeth to the
point of consenting definitely to wed a prince her junior by about a
score of years. Nor did the negotiations appear altogether hopeless. The
suitor was, indeed, we have seen, as insignificant in body as he was
contemptible in intellectual ability. Moreover, the deep traces left on
his face by the small-pox rendered him sufficiently ungainly. The blemish
was said to be increasing, instead of diminishing, with his years.<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a>
But the French courtiers might perhaps have overcome this impediment had
Elizabeth been able to see it to be her interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span> to contract such close
relations with her neighbors across the channel. As it was, an agreement
was actually made that Alençon should visit England and press his suit in
person; but when the time arrived for him to cross to Dover, Catharine
justified the despatch of Marshal de Retz in his place, on the plea of
her son's illness. The excuse may have contained some truth,<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> for,
albeit Francis of Alençon had received the baptismal name of Hercules, he
was a puny weakling, from whom no labors could ever be expected, but
rather a dull existence of sloth and imbecility. It was, however, a
stretch even of diplomatic assurance, for La Mothe Fénélon to suggest to
the virgin queen of England, as he deliberately reports that he did, that
Alençon's malady was probably due to his disappointment at Elizabeth's
failure to reciprocate his honest affection!<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> Possibly his mother
and his brother the king may about this time have begun to realize how
impolitic it would be to strengthen overmuch the personal consideration
of the young prince. Disgusted with the subordinate position assigned him
at court, and especially with the failure of his efforts to obtain the
appointment of lieutenant-general of the kingdom, lately held by Henry of
Anjou, Alençon was even now drifting into an association with the
political and religious malcontents whose existence could not altogether
be ignored. The French ambassador at the English court was, however,
instructed by no means to let the projected marriage drop.<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a></p>

<p>With the patriots in the Low Countries and with the Protestant princes of
Germany, the French agents were in even more active conference. In the
Netherlands there was a possibility of securing some high position for
Anjou or Alençon, in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span> a chance to divert the imperial crown from
the Hapsburg to the Valois family, it may reasonably be doubted whether
the project was ever distinctly entertained, as the historian De Thou
asserts,<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> of conferring upon Anjou the command in chief of the
confederates in Flanders, where it was expected that he would have a well
equipped fleet at his disposition; for the correspondence of Gaspard de
Schomberg, the French agent, contains no allusion to the proposal.
Certainly, however, France was, at least, anxious that England should
gain no advantage over her in this part of Europe. In fact, nothing but
the natural fear entertained of the great power and apparently limitless
resources of Spain deterred both Elizabeth and Charles from attempting to
secure the sovereignty of the revolted Netherlands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues with the German princes.</div>

<p>In Germany the field for intrigue was more open. The imperial dignity had
not yet become purely hereditary. In choosing a new King of the Romans,
the presumptive heir of the German Empire, the three Protestant Electors,
if they could but secure the concurrence of one of the four Roman
Catholic Electors, might have it in their power to correct the mistake
committed by Frederick the Wise of Saxony, a half-century earlier, in
declining the crown in favor of Charles of Spain. Schomberg was therefore
instructed to recommend to the Protestants of Germany and the Low
Countries, that one of their own number should be placed in the line of
succession to the Empire, or, if they could find no German Protestant
prince sufficiently powerful to oppose the Hapsburgs, that the dignity
should be offered to the King of France. This was a somewhat startling
suggestion to emanate from a king who, but a brief twelvemonth before had
been butchering his Protestant subjects by tens of thousands. But the
sixteenth century furnishes not a few paradoxes equally remarkable. Both
Protestants and Roman Catholics often found it convenient to have very
short memories. In this case, however, the proposal to set aside the son
of the tolerant Maximilian the Second in behalf of a son of Catharine de'
Medici met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span> little favor at the hands of one at least of the
Protestant leaders. The Landgrave of Hesse declared he would have nothing
to do with a project intended solely to sow divisions in the empire. The
French, since the successful issue of their intrigues in Poland, he said,
had become so arrogant that they thought they must be nothing less than
masters of the whole world.<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> As for himself, he was quite satisfied
with the present emperor, whom he prayed that God might long preserve,
and then graciously provide them in his place with a pious Christian
leader who should rule the empire well and faithfully.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Count Louis of Nassau.</div>

<p>At Blamont, in the duchy of Lorraine, Catharine took leave of the King of
Poland. Here the old ally of the Huguenots, Louis of Nassau, accompanied
by Duke Christopher, younger son of the elector palatine, met them. Louis
had been unremitting in his efforts to obtain French assistance in the
desperate struggle in which he and his brother were engaged. If words and
assurances could be of any worth, he was successful. Catharine promised
in Charles's name that France would not be behind the German Protestant
princes in rendering assistance to the Dutch patriots. Louis was so
cordially received by the queen mother, and especially by Alençon, that
he departed greatly encouraged with the prospect. Alençon had pressed the
Dutch patriot's hand, and whispered in his ear: "I now have the
government, as my brother, the King of Poland formerly had it, and I
shall devote myself wholly to seconding the efforts of the Prince of
Orange."<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> The promised succor from France Nassau never received.

count, in company with his friend and comrade, Duke Christopher, lost his

<p>With the details of the journey of Henry of Anjou to take possession of
his new kingdom, we cannot here concern ourselves. One incident, however,
naturally connects itself with the fortunes of the French Huguenots.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anjou's reception at Heidelberg.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Frankness of the elector palatine.</div>

<p>After traversing Alsace, Henry and his suite presented themselves,
unwelcome guests, at Heidelberg, capital of the palatinate. The Elector,
Frederick the Third, and his subjects were, perhaps, equally displeased
at the arrival of the prime mover in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's
Day. But, while the people felt some freedom in the expression of their
disgust, motives of state policy prevented their prince from openly
displaying his antipathy. However, he neither could nor would conceal the
lively remembrance in which the events of August, 1572, were still held
by him. It was on Friday, the eleventh of December, that the French
party, under the escort of a large body of soldiers sent out to do them
honor, ascended to the castle, then as now occupying a commanding site
overlooking the valley of the Neckar.<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> The King of Poland was
somewhat surprised when, on entering the portal, instead of the elector,
the rhinegrave, with two French refugees escaped from the massacre, came
to escort him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span> rooms prepared for his reception. Frederick had
directed the rhinegrave to request Henry to excuse this apparent
discourtesy on the ground of his feeble health. It is more probable that
the true motive was the elector's desire to avoid incurring, by too great
complaisance, the displeasure of the emperor, who was naturally much
irritated at the success of the French intrigues in Poland. When, later,
Frederick made his tardy appearance, it was only to greet Anjou in a
brief address, reserving for the morrow their more extended conference.
On Saturday the elector politely conducted his guest through his
extensive picture gallery. Pausing before one painting the face of which
was protected from sight, he ordered an attendant to draw aside the
curtain. To his astonishment, Henry found himself confronted with a
life-like portrait of Gaspard de Coligny. To the question, "Does your
Royal Highness recognize the subject?" Henry replied with sufficient
composure: "I do; it is the late Admiral of France." "Yes," rejoined
Frederick, "it is the admiral&mdash;a man whom I have found, of all the French
nobles, the most zealous for the glory of the French name; and I am not
afraid to assert that in him the king and all France have sustained an
irreparable loss." Elsewhere Henry's attention was directed to a large
painting representing the very scenes of the massacre, and he was asked
whether he could distinguish any of the victims. Nor did Frederick
confine himself to these casual references. In pointed terms he exposed
to the young Valois both the sin and the mistaken policy of the events of
a twelvemonth since. The slaughter of the admiral and of so many other
innocent men and women had not only provoked the Divine retribution, but
had diminished not a little the reputation and influence of the French
with all orders of persons in Germany.<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> Henry listened with
commendable patience to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span> old elector's denunciations, alleging by way
of excuse that the French court had been under the influence of the
passions then running high, and readily promised great caution and
tolerance in future.<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> He did, indeed, strike on his breast and
begged Frederick to believe him that things had occurred otherwise than
had been reported. But his auditor dryly remarked that he was fully
informed of what had taken place in France.<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> As the elector also
took occasion to remind Anjou of sundry miserable deaths of notorious
persecutors, such as Herod the Great, Herod Agrippa, and Maxentius; as he
openly ridiculed the absurd suggestion that Coligny, a wounded man, with
both arms disabled in consequence of Maurevel's shot, planned on his bed
an attack on the king; and as, furthermore, he plainly denounced the

<p>On Sunday the French left Heidelberg, with little regret on their own
part or on that of their hosts. Not to speak of their treatment by the
elector, which even the historian De Thou regarded as scarcely comporting
with the dignity with which Henry was invested,<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> the followers of
the Polish king met with frequent insults, both in coming and in going.
One of them relates how he heard cries of "Those dogs from Lorraine!
Those Italian traitors!" And a German eye-witness of the scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
expresses it as his opinion that the French nobles would not have been
safe had they not been escorted by the palatine troops. The sight of
"that notable cut-throat, the Duke of Nevers," of the Marshal de Retz, of
Captain Du Gast, and "very many others of that band of villains who so
cruelly butchered the admiral and other nobles in Paris," provoked the
populace almost beyond endurance. The very diamonds and jewels presented
by Henry on his departure, to the elector and to the ladies of his court,
aroused the popular indignation; for they were known, as we have already
seen, to have constituted a part of the plunder of a certain rich
Huguenot jeweller, whose shop had been robbed at the time of the Parisian
matins.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a> There were not wanting those who would even have counselled
the worthy elector to follow the course indicated by the Spanish grandee,
who informed Charles the Fifth that he intended to burn his castle to the
ground so soon as the traitorous Constable de Bourbon had relieved it of
his polluting presence.<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Last days of Chancellor de l'Hospital.</div>

<p>Meantime, within the borders of France all was ferment and disquiet. The
Roman Catholic element, comprising the overwhelming majority of the
people, had become split into two factions, both animated by
inextinguishable hatred, and each resolved to compass the destruction of
the other. Of conciliatory measures there was a dearth. Among the men of
wide influence there was no one to take the place of the virtuous Michel
de l'Hospital. That truly great statesman had died nine months before (on
the thirteenth of March, 1573). The storm of war at that moment raging
about La Rochelle was a fit expression of the utter failure of the aged
chancellor's policy. For a dozen years there had not been a candid and
sincere effort made to restore tranquillity to France which had not
either originated with him or received his cordial support. But of the
sanguine hopes of ultimate success entertained in the earlier stages of
his political career, he retained little toward its close. The last years
of his presence at court witnessed an uninterrupted struggle between the
chan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>cellor and that family of Guise which he had come to regard as the
prime cause of the misery afflicting the kingdom. More than once the
latent personal hostility had broken out in an open quarrel between
L'Hospital and the Cardinal of Lorraine. Two or three exciting scenes of
recrimination, which the tact of Catharine de' Medici was scarcely able
to allay, have met us in this history. At length, when the third civil
war burst forth, L'Hospital, seeing himself altogether powerless to
resist the more violent counsels then in the ascendant, had received
permission to retire from the royal court to his estate in the vicinity
of Étampes.<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> It was none the less an exile that it wore the
appearance of a voluntary withdrawal. Birague discharged the real
functions of the chancellor's office. Finally, after barely escaping a
violent death in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, the chancellor
received, in January, 1573, the formal order to give up the guardianship
of the seals, which for more than four years had been only nominally
under his control. His touching reply to the royal summons is the last
production of the chancellor's pen that has come down to us. Interposing
no obstacle to the execution of the king's will, the writer invoked the
testimony of the queen mother that, in all things pertaining to the royal
interests, "he had been forgetful rather of his own advantage than of the
king's service, and had always followed <i>the great royal road</i>, turning
neither to the right hand nor to the left, and giving himself to no
private faction." "And now," he added, "that my maladies and my age have
rendered me useless to do you service, just as you have seen the old
galleys in the port of Marseilles, which, though dismantled, are yet
regarded with pleasure, so I very humbly beg you to view me both in my
present state and my past, which shall be an instruction and an example
to all your subjects to do you good service. God give you grace to choose
servants and counsellors more com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>petent than I have been, and as
affectionate and devoted to your service as I am." The closing words were
characteristic of the life-long advocate of toleration: a recommendation
of gentleness and clemency, in imitation of a long-suffering and
pardoning God.<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> Two months later Michel de l'Hospital ended his
eventful life. France could ill afford to lose at this juncture a

<div class="sidenote">The party of the "Politiques."</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hotman's Franco-Gallia.</div>

<p>Since the siege of La Rochelle, or more properly since the day of the
massacre, a new party had been forming, of those who could not bring
themselves to approve the cruel acts of the court, or who, for any
reason, were jealous of the faction now in power. As opposed to the
Italian counsellors by whom the queen mother had surrounded the throne,
it was pre-eminently a French or patriotic party. It demanded the
expulsion of Florentines and of Lorrainers from the kingdom, or at least
from the management of public affairs. The "Malcontents," or
"Politiques," as they now began to be called,<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> demanded a return to
the former usages of the kingdom, in accordance with which the most
important decisions were never made without consulting the States
General. Two books appearing about this time made a deep impression. In
an anonymous treatise entitled "Franco-Gallia," the authorship of which
was speedily traced to the eminent jurist Francis Hotman, attention was
drawn to the original constitution of the kingdom; and the writer showed
by irrefragable proofs that the regal dignity was not hereditary like a
private possession, but was a gift of the people, which they could as
lawfully transfer from one to another, as originally confer. The
participation of women in the administration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span> government was
declared to be abhorrent to the ideas of the founders of the French
monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> In another work appearing not long after, the principle
was enunciated that an unbounded obedience is due to the Almighty alone,
while obedience to human magistrates is in its very nature subject to
limitations and exceptions. The supreme authority of kings and other high
magistrates was explained to be of such a nature "that if they violate
the laws, to the observance of which they have bound themselves by oath,
and become manifest tyrants, giving no room for better counsels, then it
is lawful for the inferior magistrates to make provision both for
themselves and for those committed to their charge, and oppose the
tyrant."<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> The circumstance is not without significance that in a

<div class="sidenote">Treacherous attempt on La Rochelle.</div>

<p>The lesson that no trust could be reposed in Charles and his court was
one which the world had learned pretty thoroughly before this; and the
events at La Rochelle during the month of December, 1573, were well
calculated to prevent it from being forgotten. The definite peace, made
five months before, guaranteed the safety of the Protestants, and secured
to them the free exercise of their religious rights. None the less was a
project set on foot to introduce a royal garrison into the city by
treachery. M. de Biron and other captains had been unable to conceal
their disgust at the abandonment of the siege of La Rochelle, when, as
they pretended, it must very shortly have fallen into the king's hands,
and Biron had been soundly berated by Anjou for his pains. He had not,
however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span> given up the notion of making himself master of the Huguenot
stronghold, and there were others in the royal army intent upon the same
end. A scheme to smuggle soldiers through the gates, in wagons covered
with branches of trees, was so freely talked of that it reached the
citizens' ears, and only augmented their suspicions. A more serious plot
was set on foot, in accordance with which one Jacques du Lyon, Seigneur
de Grandfief, prominent in the late defence of La Rochelle, was to gain
possession of one of the city gates, and admit Puigaillard, who, for this
purpose, had massed considerable numbers of royal soldiers at Nuaillé, on
the east, and at Saint-Vivien, on the south of La Rochelle. Happily the
treacherous design was itself betrayed by an accomplice. Grandfief was
killed while defending himself against those who had been sent to arrest
him. Several of the supposed leaders<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> were condemned to be broken on
the wheel, and the barbarous sentence was executed. The papers discovered
in the house of Grandfief clearly proved that the plot had received the
full approval not only of Biron, but of the queen mother herself. After
inflicting summary vengeance on the miserable instruments of perfidy, the
Rochellois, therefore, addressed their complaints to the French court. It
need not surprise us, however, to learn that they received in reply
letters from Charles not only disowning the conspiracy, but assuring them
that he heartily detested it, and approved the rigorous measures
adopted.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenots reassemble at Milhau.</div>

<div class="sidenote">They complete their organization.</div>

<p>Shortly before the discovery of the conspiracy at La Rochelle, the
Huguenots had again assembled at Milhau-en-Rouergue. The delegates, about
one hundred in number, represented very fully the gentry and tiers état
of the south and south-west of France, while a few names from the central
and northern provinces indicated the weaker hold gained by Protestantism
in that portion of the kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> Ostensibly meeting, with the royal
permission, to receive the report of the commissioners sent to the king,
and to entertain the terms proposed by Marshal Damville, the Huguenots
availed themselves of the opportunity to perfect the organization of
their party which had been sketched in previous political assemblies.
Accepting it as notorious that, whether in time of peace, or of open war,
or of truce, the Protestants were in peril from the daily intrigues and
assaults of their enemies, all tending to their complete ruin, the
Huguenot assembly renewed and swore to maintain a permanent union
comprising all their brethren of the same faith not only in France
proper, but in the papal Comtât Venaissin, the principality of Orange,
and other districts less closely united to the crown. To this end they
determined that the "States General," composed of a delegate from the
nobility, the tiers état, and the magistracy of each "généralité" or
government, should meet every six months; while the particular assemblies
of the governments should be convened at least as often as once in three
months. The functions of the generals and their councils were expressly
limited to the military and financial concerns of the Huguenots, with
other matters of public interest. They were strictly forbidden from
intermeddling, under any pretext, with the discharge of civil or criminal
justice. This last function was to be referred to the royal courts, save
that, instead of appealing to the parliaments, known to be too hostile to
Protestantism to afford hope of obtaining justice, arbitrators were to be
chosen by the Protestants among themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> Not forgetting their
common religious bond, the Huguenots at Milhau declared it to be the duty
of the ministers of God's word and of the consistories to keep watch over
criminal and dissolute behavior, and denounce it for punishment to the
civil magistrate. At the same time, in order that the ministers might be
the better able to devote themselves to their sacred functions, it was
directed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span> they be regularly paid from the common funds "without
making any further use of notices (billettes) or other unworthy and
illusory methods, as has been done heretofore, to the great scandal of
all good people." The levy of imposts and the creation of loans were made
the exclusive right of the particular states, while the administration of
the funds arising from the royal revenues was to be intrusted to the
provincial councils.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p>Such were the chief features in a plan for organization evidently looking
to the speedy renewal of the warfare temporarily suspended by virtue of
the truce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Duke of Alençon.</div>

<p>While the revelation of the treacherous attempt of the royal party upon
La Rochelle proved to the Politiques, or Malcontents, the impossibility
of relying upon the assurances given in the name of Charles the Ninth,
the resolutions of the Huguenots in Milhau encouraged them in their
project to remove the present advisers of the king. In the absence of any
better leader, they looked to the Duke of Alençon as their head. He alone
of the royal family was guiltless of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's
Day. His antagonism to Anjou and to his mother was well known. It was
even reported that he had himself been exposed to serious danger by
reason of his avowed sympathy with the imprisoned King of Navarre and his
cousin of Condé. In fact, he was himself little better than a captive at
the court of Charles&mdash;eyed with suspicion, unable to obtain favors for
his friends, and vainly suing to be appointed to the office of
lieutenant-general of the kingdom. It was perhaps not strange that, in
looking about for a nominal head, the Politiques should have settled upon
Alençon, who received their overtures with undisguised satisfaction and
large promises of support. And yet there could scarcely have been a more
unhappy selection. Of the feeble children of Catharine de' Medici, he was
undoubtedly the feeblest. He possessed neither the courage to undertake
nor the fortitude to prosecute any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span> really bold enterprise. All who had
the misfortune at any time to credit his plighted word discovered in
their own cases a fresh and pointed application of the warning against
putting trust in princes. Of him Busbec, the emperor's ambassador, gave a
life-like delineation when he characterized him as "a prince who allowed
himself to be ensnared by the bad counsels of unskilful ministers, who
could not distinguish friends from flatterers, nor a great from a good
reputation; ready to undertake, still more ready to desist; always
inconstant, restless, and frivolous; always prepared to disturb the best
established tranquillity."<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Glandage plunders the city of Orange.</div>

<p>Circumstances almost beyond their control seemed now to be forcing the
Huguenots to make common cause with the Malcontents. Yet there were not
wanting those who looked upon the alliance as more likely to retard than
to advance their true interests, and who pointed with convincing force to
the disastrous results of a similar union in the time of the tumult of
Amboise, fourteen years before. The cloak of the reformed name, they
argued, would certainly be assumed by men having no desire for a
reformation of manners or morals&mdash;men whose lives would only dishonor the
cause with which they were supposed to be identified. Nor was the fear an
idle one, as was shown by an incident that occurred about this very time.
The truce which had been made for Languedoc did not extend to the Comtât
Venaissin. Naturally enough, there were many in the Huguenot ranks who,
remembering past injuries received at the hands of the troops of the
Pope, were not unwilling to turn their arms in this direction. But their
leader was no Huguenot. M. de Glandage, a gentleman of Dauphiny, was a
soldier of fortune, and would doubtless have fought with as little
reluctance against the Protestants as for them, had it been to his
advantage to enlist under the papal standard. As it was otherwise, he
made himself master of the city of Orange, with the assistance of a party
of citizens, and expelled Berchon, who, in the name of William the
Silent, had strictly abstained from acts of hostility against the
neighboring pontifi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>cal towns. Not so with the new governor of Orange.
The city became the starting-point for a continuous series of incursions.
It was not war, but open rapine. The very traders were plundered of their
wares when they fell into his hands. One might have fancied that a
mediæval robber-baron had reappeared on the banks of the Rhône. It was
true that Glandage, making a virtue of bluntness, was wont to say that
"there was nothing Huguenot about him but the point of his sword." None
the less did his violent acts bring discredit upon the Huguenots.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Montbrun's exploits in Dauphiny.</div>

<p>Although war had not yet been formally resumed, there were parts of
France in which it already raged, or rather where peace had never been
restored. This was the case in particular on both banks of the Rhône, in
Dauphiny and in Vivarez and the adjoining districts. So rapid had been
the movements of the veteran Huguenot chief Montbrun, and so successful
every blow he struck, that terror spread far and wide. Important towns
fell into his hands; a rich abbey but a few miles from Grenoble was
plundered, and the silent monks of St. Bruno, in the secluded retreat of
the Grande Chartreuse&mdash;the mother house of their order&mdash;were glad to
summon troops to defend their rich fields from a similar fate.<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> From

forces.<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">La Rochelle resumes arms. Beginning of the fifth religious
war.</div>

<p>But the time for hollow truce and a desultory and irregular warfare was
rapidly passing away. It was but little more than a month after the
beginning of the new year before the conflagration again burst forth. The
Protestants of all parts of the kingdom were at length of one mind; there
was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span> room for doubt that any hopes offered them had as their sole
object to sow discord among the adherents of the reformed faith. If
anything had been wanting to prove this, it was made clear by the refusal
of the court to extend the benefits of the Edict of Pacification of July,
1573, to the whole of France. The limitation of the liberty of worship by
the provisions of that edict to La Rochelle, Montauban, and Nismes, was
evidently intended to render the inhabitants of the three strongest
Huguenot cities selfishly indifferent to the injustice done to their
brethren in other parts of France. In fact, this result was partially
effected in the first of the cities named. The Rochellois were at first
very reluctant to resume hostilities, and began to plead conscientious
scruples forbidding them to break the compact made with the king. Happily
their hesitation was removed by François de la Noue, who, returning in a
capacity entirely different from that in which he had last appeared, used
all the arts of persuasion to induce the Huguenot stronghold by the sea
to become again the rallying-point for the Protestants of the west. It
was not difficult to show the citizens, when once they would listen to
reason, that the starving of Sancerre and numberless murders of adherents
of the reformed doctrine throughout France were violations of the peace
quite sufficient to justify its formal abrogation by the injured party.
The fears dictated by apparent weakness were dispelled by pointing to the
signal success that had crowned the arms of Montbrun in Dauphiny,<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>
while the reluctance of loyal subjects to rise in arms against their
lawful sovereign, even in order to redress great wrongs, unless
authorized by the leadership of a prince of the blood, was answered by
the assurance that they would have a head of much higher rank than any
under whose protection the Huguenots had heretofore taken the
field.<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> It was clear that the personage thus hinted at could be no
other than the king's brother. No wonder that the Rochellois yielded to
La Noue's arguments, for almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span> every Roman Catholic whose hands were
clean of the blood shed in the massacre applauded the justice of the new
uprising.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Diplomacy tried in vain.</div>

<p>The city of La Rochelle began again to repair its shattered walls, and La
Noue was unanimously appointed to the chief command of the Huguenots in
Saintonge and the adjacent regions. In the effort next made to prevent
the great Protestant leader from espousing the side of his brethren, and
to persuade the city of La Rochelle to rest content with the guarantees
offered by the edict of 1573, and remain neutral in the coming conflict,
Catharine and her advisers signally failed. The royal envoys&mdash;Biron,
Strozzi and Pinart&mdash;were, indeed, courteously treated by La Noue,
Frontenay, and Mirambeau, who repeatedly came out to meet them at the
village of Ernandes. But the Huguenots, in reply to their reiterated
request, declined absolutely to abate a single important point in their
demands. They would not hear the suggestion that by the Edict of
Boulogne, in 1573, previous ordinances had been repealed, but persisted
in assuming that Charles had always intended that the edict of 1570
should remain in force, and, in proof of this, they alleged one of the
king's own declarations after the massacre. They insisted that the
privileges accorded to the three privileged cities of La Rochelle,
Montauban, and Nismes, should be extended to the Protestant nobility
throughout the kingdom; and when Biron and his companions reluctantly
consented that the right to have baptism and marriage celebrated in their
houses be conceded to all Protestant noblemen who enjoyed the right of
"haute justice," and who had always remained constant in their religious
opinions, La Noue protested against the restriction to baptism and
marriage. "We desire to worship God freely," he said, "and you give only
a part of what we need for the exercise of our religion. What you offer
is a snare to catch us again and expose us to greater peril than we were
ever in before. But we would much rather die with arms in our hands than
be involved again in such disasters."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span></p>

<p>In vain did the royalists assure them that the king was ready to grant
the Protestants complete liberty of conscience and protection against
their enemies, but could not give them what they demanded. In vain did
they repeat in substance the famous exclamation of Catharine de' Medici,
and say, among other arguments: "You could make no greater demands if the
king had nothing ready, and you had a large and powerful army, with all
the advantages you could desire; whereas, we know full well that you are
feeble in every direction, and that the king has great forces, as you
yourselves must be aware." The Huguenots had the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew's Day on their tongues continually,<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> and could not be
fed with fair promises. They required securities. First, Charles must
give them a city in each province of the kingdom, as a refuge in case
they were assailed. Next, the maintenance of the promises made to them
must be guaranteed by the signatures of the princes of the blood and all
the chief nobles, by governors, by lieutenants-general, and by the gentry
of the provinces, as well as by the chief inhabitants of the towns.
Hostages must be interchanged. While the last and most remarkable
proposal of all was, "that his Majesty, on his part, and the Huguenots,
on theirs, should place a large sum of money in the hands of some German
prince, who should promise to employ it in levying and paying a body of
reiters to be used against that party which should violate the peace."
All this was to be registered in the various parliaments and in the
inferior courts of the bailiwicks and sénéchaussées. The king was further
requested to call the States General within three months, to give the
royal edict of pacification their formal sanction.<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a></p>

<p>We need not be surprised that a conference to which the two parties

<div class="sidenote">The "Politiques" make an unsuccessful rising.</div>

<p>It scarcely falls within the province of this history to narrate in
detail the unsuccessful attempt of the Malcontents, made some weeks
before the negotiations just described, to overthrow the government,
whose bad counsels were believed to be the cause of the misery under
which France was groaning; for the alliance between the Malcontents and
the Huguenots was only fortuitous and partial. A few words of
explanation, however, seem to be necessary. The plan contemplated a
simultaneous uprising on the tenth of March. The day had been selected by
La Noue himself, who rightly judged that the license and uproar indulged
in by the populace up to a late hour in the night of "Mardi Gras" (Shrove
Tuesday) would greatly facilitate the military undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> Alençon
and the King of Navarre, who, since the massacre immediately succeeding
his nuptials, had found himself less a guest than a captive at court,
were to flee secretly to Sedan, where they would find safety under the
protection of the Duc de Bouillon. For the influence of this great
nobleman, together with the still more powerful support of the
Montmorency family, was given to the projected movement. But the timidity
and vacillation of Alençon frustrated the well-conceived design. Ten days
or a fortnight before the set time for the escape of the princes from
court, Navarre, who, under pretext of hunting, had been allowed to leave
the royal palace of Saint Germain, received a secret visit from M. de
Guitry, a gentleman who had succeeded in bringing into the vicinity an
armed body of the confederates. The meeting took place by night, in
Navarre's bedchamber, in the little hamlet of St. Prix.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> On the
morrow Guitry found means to confer with M. de Thoré, Turenne, and La
Nocle, "all in despair by reason of Alençon's variable moods."<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> This
feeble prince, it would seem, was not even yet decided, and trembled at
the peril he might run in at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>tempting to reach Sedan. Under these
circumstances the plan of flight was modified. Guitry was instructed to
bring his force nearer to St. Germain, and wait for Alençon and Navarre,
who, under his escort, were to gain Mantes, a little farther down the
Seine, and perhaps ultimately join the confederates near La Rochelle.
Guitry waited in vain: Alençon and Navarre never came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flight of the court from St. Germain.</div>

<p>Either Alençon himself, or La Mole, his favorite, in his name, betrayed
the project to the queen mother. The discovery of a body of armed men in
the vicinity, albeit they gave assurance that they meant no injury to the
king, threw the entire court into consternation. Catharine, reminding
Charles that her soothsayers had long since warned her of Saint Germain
as a place that boded no good to her or hers, was among the first to
flee, leaving the king, who was ill with quartan fever, to follow the
next day.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> The court partook of Catharine's terror, and imitated her
example. Layman and churchman vied in haste to gain Paris, whence in a
few days they retreated in a more leisurely manner to the safer refuge of
the castle of Vincennes. While some hurried by the main road, or picked
their way along the banks of the Seine, others took to boats as a less
dangerous means of conveyance. But, among those who joined in the
disorderly flight, there were some who retained their composure
sufficiently to note the ludicrous features of the scene. Long after they
recalled with undisguised amusement the terror-stricken countenances of
the new chancellor and of three French cardinals, as, mounted on fiery
Italian or Spanish steeds, they clung with both hands to the saddle-bow,
evidently fearing their horses even more than the dreaded Huguenot.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>
It was a very pretty farce; but the tragedy was yet to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">A second failure.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Alençon and Navarre examined.</div>

<p>A second attempt at flight made by Alençon and Navarre also failed,
through the treachery of one of those to whom the secret had been
confided. Alençon and Navarre were now placed under close guard, and
subjected to long and repeated examinations before a royal commission.
Alençon was sufficiently craven in his bearing, and did not hesitate by
his admissions to involve in ruin the minor instruments in the execution
of the plan. Navarre, in his answers to the interrogatories, displayed a
courageous frankness. He was not, in truth, content with a simple denial
of the evil designs attributed to him. On the contrary, he availed
himself of the opportunity to rehearse the grievances under which he had
been suffering for nearly two years. Detained at court only to find
himself an object of suspicion, his ears had been filled with successive
rumors of an approaching massacre, a second St. Bartholomew's Day, when
he would not be spared in the general destruction. These rumors had,
indeed, been declared false by the Duke of Anjou, before the walls of La
Rochelle, but that prince had failed to keep the promises made before his
departure for Poland&mdash;to commend Navarre to the royal favor. Consequently
he had been subjected to the indignity of frequently being refused
admission to the presence of Charles, while seeing La Chastre, and others
of those who had figured most prominently among the actors in the
Parisian matins, freely received at the king's rising. He had at length
resolved to leave the court in company with his cousin of Alençon, partly
in order to consult his own safety, partly that he might restore order in
his estates of Béarn and Navarre, now suffering from his protracted
absence. When his design had come to the queen mother's knowledge, he had
explained the motives of his action to her, and obtained the promise of
her protection. Subsequently there had reached him the intelligence that
he was to be imprisoned with Alençon in the castle of Vincennes;
whereupon he had renewed the attempt to escape the impending peril. In
his second examination, in the presence of Catharine de' Medici and his
uncle, Cardinal Bourbon, Henry reiterated his statements respecting the
alarming reports that continually reached him. At one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span> he learned
that it was decided that, should Margaret of Navarre bear a son, the
luckless father would be put out of the way, in order that the child
might inherit his dignities. At another time, in the very chamber of King
Charles, the opinion had been boldly uttered, that, so long as a single
member of the house of Bourbon should survive, there would always be war
in France. Nor had the young prince dared to complain of these
menaces.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a></p>

<p>It was no part of Catharine de' Medici's plan, at this juncture, to wreak
her vengeance for the blow that had been aimed at her authority, either
upon her son or upon her son-in-law. The Montmorencies, also, though
suspected and long since the objects of jealousy, ultimately escaped with
little difficulty. It is true that the eldest brother, Marshal François
de Montmorency, was enticed to the court, as was also another marshal, M.
de Cossé, and that both were thrown into the Bastile. But the younger
Montmorencies, Thoré and Méru, had escaped, while their more energetic
brother Marshal Damville, was too firmly fixed in the governorship of
Languedoc, to be removed without a struggle. It was hardly prudent to
drive so influential a family to extremities. Moreover, Catharine was too
wise to desire the utter destruction of a clan whose authority might on
occasion be employed, as it had often been in the past, as a counterpoise
to the formidable power of the Guises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Execution of La Mole and Coconnas.</div>

<p>Some victims of inferior rank were needed. They were found in the persons
of Joseph Boniface de la Mole and Hannibal, Count de Coconnas, who, with
one M. de Tourtray, expiated their error and that of their superiors, on
the Place de Grève. The cruel procedure known as the administration of
justice in the sixteenth century has no more striking illustration than
in the barbarous torture, including the terrible trial by water,
inflicted upon these wretched men. By such means it was not difficult to
extort admissions which the prisoner was likely to retract at a
subsequent time. Consequently it is not quite clear, even with the full
record before us, how far La Mole and Coconnas were really impli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>cated.
As for the sufferers themselves, there was little about them to call
forth our special sympathy. La Mole, of handsome appearance, but of
cowardly disposition, was a firm believer in the magic that passed
current in his day, and was questioned on the rack respecting the object
of a waxen figure found among his effects. He admitted he had employed it
for sorcery, to advance his suit with a lady whose love he sought.
Coconnas, an Italian, instead of inviting contempt for his poltroonery,
inspires aversion for his crimes. No assassin had distinguished himself
more at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. We are inclined to believe
the contemporary chronicler, who states that Charles the Ninth himself
averred that he had never liked Coconnas since hearing the latter's
sanguinary boast that he had redeemed as many as thirty Huguenots from
the hands of the populace, only that he might induce them to abjure their
religion, under promise of life, and afterward enjoy the satisfaction of
murdering them by inches under his dagger.<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a></p>

<p>Had Coconnas and La Mole been persons more entitled to our respect, we
might have pitied their misfortune in falling into the hands of a royal
commission with whom the evidence of the guilt of the prisoners was
apparently of less weight than the desire to gratify the court by their
condemnation. The first president of parliament, Christopher de Thou,
again headed the commission. The same pliant tool of despotism who had
signed the death-warrant of Prince Louis of Condé, just before the sudden
close of the brief reign of Francis the Second, and had congratulated
Charles the Ninth, twelve years later, in the name of the judiciary of
the kingdom, on the "piety" he had displayed in butchering his
unoffending subjects, again obeyed with docility the instructions of his
superiors, and suppressed those more generous sentiments, which, if we
may credit his son's account, he secretly entertained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condé retires to Germany.</div>

<p>Meantime the arrests and judicial proceedings at the capital did not
delay the military enterprise in which the Huguenots and Malcontents were
alike embarked. More fortunate than his cousin of Navarre, the Prince of
Condé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span> chancing to be in Picardy at the outbreak of the pretended
conspiracy of St. Germain, took Thoré's advice and fled out of the
kingdom to Strasbourg.<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> Himself free from the dangers encompassing
his confederates in France, he was able to assist them materially by
addressing personal solicitations to the German princes, and by
superintending the levy of auxiliary troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons for the success of the Huguenots in face of great
difficulties.</div>

<p>The Huguenots were entering in good earnest upon the fifth religious war,
and used their successes with such moderation as to conciliate even
hostile populations. Their enemies, judging only from superficial
indications, might wonder at their strange recuperative energies.
Catharine might exclaim, in amazement at their progress and presumption,
that "the Huguenots were like cats, for, in falling, they always alighted
on their feet."<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> But those who looked into the matter more closely
saw that this was no mere accident. A contemporary writer, who is also a
declared antagonist, praises their prudence and good conduct at the
present juncture. "We must not be astonished," he remarks, "if in a short
time the Protestants carry through such great repairs and so difficult to
be believed. No sooner have they set foot in a place than they consider
its position and deliberate as to what can be done to render it strong,
or at least tenable. In all diligence they execute their decisions and
enterprises, however great and difficult they may be, by the good order
they practise and by a prompt obedience to the commands given them. So
that I confess that they surpass us in prudence and conduct. Moreover, so
soon as they are in a place, they appoint persons in whom they have the
greatest confidence, to collect the king's revenues, as well as the
income of the ecclesiastics and of those bearing arms against them,
without regard for any save the gentilhommes. Their receipts are
faithfully applied to the benefit of their cause, and they know how to
employ these sums so well, that with little money they carry on great
enterprises. So far as possible they relieve the poor husbandmen. In
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span> they conform to the fashion of the Indians, who, in time of war, do
not injure the laborers, their families, their beasts of burden, and the
implements used in cultivating the earth, but abstain from burning their
houses and villages, and leave them in peace, deeming the tillers of the
ground to be ministers of the common weal and the nursing fathers of the
other estates.<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> ... If necessity constrain them to make use of the
husbandmen, they bring them to it as freely and graciously as possible,
more by fair words than by force, employing caresses, and meantime
protecting their cattle, their harvests, and all their property. When
marching through the country, without indulging in insolence, abusive
language, or plunder, they eat what they find in the houses, and keep
their soldiers under good control. They instantly establish in the places
they hold a council of the most capable and experienced persons.... This
they convene daily and for so long a time as their affairs demand, and
here they listen to the complaints made to them, whether by word of mouth
or by written petition, and answer as well as they can to the
satisfaction of the plaintiffs."<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Montgomery lands in Normandy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He is forced to surrender and is taken prisoner.</div>

<p>About the same time that Condé was leaving France for Germany, another
Huguenot leader was entering it from the opposite quarter. Count
Montgomery, who from England had come to the island of Jersey, suddenly
made his appearance in western Normandy. In this province the Huguenots
had lately made themselves masters of the important town of Saint Lô, as
well as of Domfront on the borders of the province of Maine.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> To
these gains Montgomery soon added Carentan, an important point on the
north, which he took care to provision. He seemed likely, indeed, to
bring all this extensive territory under the power of the Protestants.
His brilliant career was, however, destined to be very brief. The royal
forces sent against him under Matignon were strong, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span> own troops were
few. From Saint Lô, where he was besieged, he succeeded by a bold dash in
escaping with a small company of horse; but at Domfront, whither he
betook himself in hope of receiving reinforcements from the south, his
manly defence availed nothing. Against an army of four thousand foot and
one thousand horse, besides a large number of Roman Catholic gentlemen
serving at their own charges, the little band of not over ninety
arquebusiers and fifty horse could offer no protracted resistance.
Domfront, strong in itself, was commanded by neighboring heights, and the
walls, through long neglect, had become so weak that they crumbled and
fell at the very first cannonade. Montgomery, deserted by some of his
soldiers and enfeebled by the loss of others, was compelled to surrender
to the besieging army. The story was current that he had received a
pledge of life and liberty at the hands of Matignon.<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> But Agrippa
d'Aubigné is undoubtedly correct in declaring that the report was a
mistaken one, and that Montgomery barely received the assurance that he
would be placed in the hands of the king alone. "There have been only too
many acts of perfidy in France, without the invention of others," says
this historian. "If there were any infractions of the capitulation, they
were in the case of some other gentlemen and soldiers, who were
maltreated or slain."<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Delight of Catharine de' Medici.</div>

<p>There was one person to whom the capture of Count Montgomery was
peculiarly gratifying. Catharine de' Medici had never forgotten the
murderous wound Montgomery's lance had inflicted upon her husband in the
rough tournament held in honor of Isabella's nuptials. True, the count
had entered the lists with Henry only by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span> king's express command, and
the fatal effects of the blow that shattered Henry's visor and drove the
splintered stock into his eye, were due to no malicious intent.
Nevertheless, Montgomery was never sincerely forgiven; and when the
slayer of the father was captured fighting against the son, Catharine
resolved that no considerations of pity should prevent his expiating his
unintended crime. Nor was the Roman Catholic party loth to see summary
punishment inflicted upon Montgomery in revenge for the blow he had
struck the "noblesse" of Béarn and the frightful slaughter of their
partisans he had authorized, five years before, during the third civil
war, at the storming of Orthez.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> On the other hand, the Parisian
populace was excited by the revival of the false rumor already referred
to, that Count Montgomery, glorying in the mischance whereby France was
robbed of her king, had substituted for his ancestral coat of arms a
novel escutcheon of his own device, whereon was figured a broken
lance.<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> It need not surprise us, therefore, that though guiltless of
any crime of which the law of even that cruel age ordinarily took
cognizance, the Huguenot leader, after being placed on the rack in the
vain attempt to obtain from him admissions criminating his associates,
was condemned, as a traitor found in arms against his king, to be
beheaded and quartered, on the Place de Grève, on the twenty-sixth of
June, 1574.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Execution of Montgomery on the Place de Grève.</div>

<p>Both enemies and friends unite in testifying to the fortitude with which
Count Montgomery underwent the execution of his severe sentence. Roman
Catholic writers, indeed, hint that he may have received profit from the
ministrations of five or six theological doctors, to whom they represent
him as gladly listening.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> But Protestant historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span> give us a
circumstantial account that seems better entitled to credit, and leaves
no room for doubt that Gabriel de Montgomery died constant to the faith
which he had embraced in his retirement, after the death of Henry the
Second. He refused to confess to the famous Vigor, Archbishop of
Narbonne, and would neither kiss the crucifix offered to him by the
priest who rode with him in the tumbrel, nor listen to his words, nor
even look at him. To a Gray Friar, who attempted to convince him that he
was in error and had been deceived, he replied: "How deceived? If I have
been deceived, it was by members of your own order; for the first person
that ever gave me a Bible in French, and bade me read it, was a
Franciscan like yourself. And therein I learned the religion that I now
hold, which is the only true religion. Having lived in it ever since, I
wish, by the grace of God, to die in it to-day." On the scaffold, after a
touching address to the spectators, he recited in a loud voice the
Apostles' Creed, in the confession of which he protested that he died,
and then, "having made his prayer to God after the manner of those of the
(reformed) religion,"<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> manfully offered his neck to the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span></p><p>But the scene just described belongs strictly to the reign of the next
French monarch. The capture of Montgomery at Domfront had been followed,
within three days, by the death of the young king against whom the count
had been fighting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last days of Charles IX.</div>

<p>It is difficult to determine the exact proportions in which physical
weakness and remorse for the past entered as ingredients of the malady
that cut short the life of Charles the Ninth. It may not be prudent to
accept implicitly all the stories told by contemporaries respecting the
wretched fancies to which the king became a victim. But it would be
carrying historical scepticism to the very verge of absurdity to reject
the whole series of reports that come down to us respecting the strange
hallucinations of Charles during the last months of his life. De Thou,
perhaps the most candid and dispassionate historian of the period, has
left the statement on record that, ever since St. Bartholomew's Day,
Charles, who at no time slept well, used frequently to have his rest
broken by the sudden recollection of its dreadful scenes. To lull him to
repose, his attendants had no resource but singing, the king being
passionately fond of music and of poetry.<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> Agrippa d'Aubigné
corroborates the statement, adding, on the authority of high noblemen who
had been present, that the king would awake trembling and groaning, and
that his agitation was sure to find expression in frightful imprecations
and words expressive of utter despair.<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a></p>

<p>With the growing certainty of his approaching death, the mental distress
of Charles proportionately increased. His old Huguenot nurse, to whom he
talked without reserve, was the witness of the startling conflict through
which he was passing in his last hours. While sitting near his bedside on
one occasion, she was suddenly recalled from a revery by the sound of the
sighs and sobs of the royal patient. To her solicitous questions as to
the cause of his distress, she received the most piteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span> exclamations,
interrupted by weeping: "Ah, my nurse, my friend, how much blood! how
many murders! Ah, what wicked counsels have I had! My God, have pity upon
me and pardon me! I know not where I am; so perplexed and agitated have
they made me. What will become of me? What shall I do? I am lost; I know
it full well." The pious attendant's earnest exhortations and consoling
words had little effect in dispelling the gloom that had settled on the
termination of a life so auspiciously begun. She might pray, in his
hearing, that the blood of the murdered Huguenots might be on the heads
of those who gave the young king such treacherous advice. She might
encourage and urge him to rest in the confidence that, in view of his
penitence, God would not impute to him his crime, but cover him with the
mantle of Christ's righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> Her words had little power to
dissipate his extreme despondency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distress of his young queen.</div>

<p>For months the life of Charles had been despaired of. Now he was visibly
dying. The news of the capture of Montgomery, which his mother came to
announce to him with a delight she neither was able nor anxious to hide,
brought him no pleasure. He had, he said, ceased to care for these
things. Meanwhile, Catharine, if not altogether devoid of natural
affection&mdash;if not experiencing unmingled satisfaction at the prospect
that the sceptre was likely to pass into the hands of her favorite son,
the King of Poland&mdash;at least took care to provide for the contingency of
Charles's speedy death, by obtaining, on the twenty-ninth of May, letters
to the governors of provinces, and the next day the more authoritative
letters patent conferring upon her the regency until the return of Henry
from Poland.<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> More sincere in her sorrow, the young Queen Elizabeth,
Charles's wife, endeavored to ward off the stroke of Heaven by solemn
processions. For nine successive days, laying aside all tokens of her
royal rank, simply clad, and with uncovered face, she walked barefooted,
and accompanied by a large number of poor boys and girls, from the wood
of Vincennes, where the court still lingered, to the city of Paris.
After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span> devoutly praying for the king's recovery at the Sainte-Chapelle
and at the shrine of Notre Dame, she returned from her pilgrimage in the
same painful and humble manner, her ladies and the officers of her court
following at a respectful distance.<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a></p>

<p>Upon Sorbin, the king's confessor, devolved the duty of administering to
Charles the last rites of religion&mdash;Sorbin, who was accustomed to speak
of the perfidy and cruelty of the massacre as true magnanimity and
gentleness. It has been well remarked that, in all the dark drama of
guilt and retribution upon which the curtain was about to fall, no part
is more tragic than the scene in which the last words preparing the soul
for judgment were spoken by such a confessor as Sorbin to such a penitent
as Charles.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> Under such spiritual guidance the unhappy boy-king may

<p>On Sunday, May the thirtieth, 1574, the festival of Pentecost, Charles
died, late in the afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> Almost his last words had been of

and kingdom were wretched.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Charles.</div>

<p>The general usage was not violated in the present instance. Charles, like
a host of prominent princes and statesmen of the sixteenth century, was
currently reported to have fallen a victim to the poisoner's art, then in
its prime. Nor did the examina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>tion made after his death, though clearly
proving that the event had a natural cause, suffice to clear away the
unhappy impression.<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> The Huguenots had, perhaps, more reason than
others to regard the circumstances attending it as strange, if not
miraculous. That the king, whose guilty acquiescence in the murderous
scheme of Catharine, Anjou, and Guise, had deluged his realm in blood,
should himself have perished of a malady that caused blood to exude from
every pore in his body,<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> was certainly sufficiently singular to
arrest the attention of the world. The phenomenon has been shown beyond
all question to have many parallels in the annals of medicine.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> But
the coincidence was so remarkable that we scarcely wonder that, in the
eyes of many, it partook of a supernatural character.</p>

<p>Thus perished, in the twenty-fourth year of his age, a prince whom fair
natural endowments seemed to have destined to play a creditable, if not a
resplendent part in the history of his period; but whom the evil counsels
and examples of his mother, and the corrupt education which, designedly
or through an unfortunate accident, she had given him, had so depraved,
that his morals were regarded with disgust and reprobation by an age by
no means scrupulously pure.<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The funeral rites.</div>

<p>The forty days' funeral rites were performed in honor of the deceased
king with all the detail of pomp customary on such occasions. For forty
days, on a bed of cloth of gold, lay in state the life-like effigy of
Charles of Valois, dressed in crimson and blue satin, and in ermine, with
a jewelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span> crown upon its head, and with sceptre and other emblems of
royalty at its side. For forty days the service of the king's table
remained unchanged, and the pleasing fiction was maintained that the
monarch was yet alive. The gentlemen in waiting, the cupbearer, the
pantler, the carver, and all the retinue of servants who, as in feudal
times, appeared at the royal meals, discharged each his appointed office
with punctilious precision. Courses of viands were brought on in regular
succession, and as regularly removed from the board. A cardinal or
prelate blessed the table before the empty show of a meal, and rendered
thanks at its conclusion. Only at the close, by the sad repetition of the
De profundis, and other psalms appropriate to funeral occasions, did the
pageant differ materially from many a scene of convivial entertainment in
which Charles had taken part. When the prescribed term of waiting was at
length over, the miserable show ended, the effigy was replaced by the
bier, funeral decorations took the place of festive emblems, and the body
of the late king was laid in its last resting-place.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Had persecution, war, and treachery succeeded?</div>

<p>The courtiers had already turned their eyes from the dead monarch to the
successor whose speedy return from Poland all eagerly awaited. Henry the
Third had already precipitately fled from Cracow, and was on his way to
assume his ancestral throne. He was to find the kingdom plunged in
disquiet, a prey to internal discord fostered by foreign princes. Neither
Huguenot nor Roman Catholic was satisfied. A full half-century from the
first promulgation of the reformed doctrines by Lefèvre d'Étaples found
the friends of the purer faith more resolute than ever in its assertion,
despite fire, massacre, and open warfare. No candid beholder could deny
that the system of persecution had thus far proved an utter failure. It
remained to be seen whether the new king would choose to repeat a
dangerous experiment.</p>

formerly belonging to the library of Ludovico Manini, the last doge of
Venice. From 1570 on I refer to the edition of 1575, which comprises a
fourth and rarer volume, bringing down the history to the close of the
reign of Charles. A comparison between this edition and the later edition
of 1577 brings out the interesting circumstance that many Huguenots of
little courage, who at first apostatized, afterward returned to their old
faith. Thus, the edition of 1575 reads (iv. 51 <i>v.</i>): "Vix enim dici
possit, quam multi ad primum illum impetum a Religione resiluerint,
mortis amittendarumque facultatum metu, <i>quorum plerique etiamnum hærent

which was not for the interest of both; and it was, therefore, no

represents La Chastre as desirous of destroying the entire city; while
Léry (p. 77) and Davila (p. 193) are in doubt whether Johanneau's murder
was not effected by his orders. Yet Léry himself records a conversation
he held about this time with La Chastre (p. 67), in which the latter
protested that he was not, as commonly reported, of a sanguinary
disposition, and appealed for corroboration to his merciful treatment of
some Huguenot prisoners that fell into his hands in the third civil war,
whom he refused to surrender to the Parisian parliament when formally
summoned to do so. Claude de la Chastre's noble letter to Charles IX., of
January 21, 1570 (Bulletin, iv. 28), seems to be a sufficient voucher for
his veracity. See <i>ante</i>, chapter xvi., p. 345.</p></div>

could we believe that inordinate fondness for the dance was the chief
vice of the French court. Unfortunately the moral turpitude of the king
and his favorites rests upon less suspicious grounds than the revolting
stories told on hearsay by the unfriendly writer of the Eusebii
Philadelphi Dialogi (Edinburgi, 1574), ii. 117, 118. The "Affair of
Nantouillet," occurring just about the time of the Polish ambassadors'
arrival in Paris, is only too authentic. The "Prévôt de Paris," M. de
Nantouillet (cf. <i>ante</i>, chapter xv., page 258, note), grandson of
Cardinal du Prat, Chancellor of France under Francis I., offended Anjou
by somewhat contemptuously declining the hand of the duke's discarded
mistress, Mademoiselle de Châteauneuf. The lady easily induced her
princely lover to avenge her wounded vanity. One evening Charles IX., the
new king of Poland, the King of Navarre, the Grand Prior of France, and
their attendants, presented themselves at the stately mansion of
Nantouillet, on the southern bank of the Seine, opposite the Louvre, and
demanded that a banquet be prepared for them. Though the royal party was
masked, the unwilling host knew his guests but too well, and dared not
deny their peremptory command. In the midst of the carousal, at a
preconcerted signal, the king's followers began to ransack the house,
maltreating the occupants, wantonly destroying the costly furniture,
appropriating the silver plate, and breaking open doors and coffers in
search of money. The next day even Paris itself was indignant at the base
conduct of its king. To the first president of parliament, who that day
visited the palace and informed Charles of the current rumors respecting
his having been present and conniving at the pillage, the despicable
monarch denied their truth with his customary horrible imprecation. But
when the president expressed his great satisfaction, and said that
parliament would at once institute proceedings to discover and punish the
guilty, Charles promptly responded: "By no means. You will lose your
trouble;" and he added a significant threat for Nantouillet, that, should
he pursue his attempt to obtain satisfaction, he would find that he had
to do with an opponent infinitely his superior. Euseb. Phil. Dialogi, ii.

It ought to be noted that the Montauban assembly in reality did little
more than confirm the regulations drawn up by previous and less
conspicuous political assemblies of the Huguenots held at Anduze in
February, and at Réalmont, in May, 1573. This clearly appears from
references to that earlier legislation contained in the more complete
"organization" adopted four months later at Milhau. See the document in
Haag, France Protestante, x. (Pièces justificatives) 124, 125. M. Jean
Loutchitzki has published in the Bulletin, xxii. (1873) 507-511, a list

(ii. 131) a full account of Montgomery's address, which he himself heard,
mounted, as he informs us, "en croupe" behind M. de Fervaques, to whom
Montgomery bade farewell just before his death. The Huguenot captain made
but two requests of the bystanders: "the first, that they would tell his
children, whom the judges had declared to be degraded to the rank of
'roturiers,' that, if they had not virtue of nobility enough to reassert
their position, their father consented to the act; as for the other
request, he conjured them, by the respect due to the words of a dying
man, not to represent him to others as beheaded for any of the reasons
assigned in his judicial condemnation&mdash;his wars, expeditions, and ensigns
won&mdash;subjects of frivolous praise to vain men&mdash;but to make him the
companion in cause and in death of so many simple persons according to
the world&mdash;old men, young men, and poor women&mdash;who in that same place
(the Place de Grève) had endured fire and knife." D'Aubigné's narrative,
as usual, is vivid, and mentions somewhat trivial details, which,
however, are additional pledges of its accuracy; <i>e.g.</i>, he alludes to
the fact that, having spoken as above to those who stood on the side
toward the river, he repeated his remarks to those on the other side of
the Place de Grève, beginning with the words, "I was saying to the men
yonder," etc.</p></div>
